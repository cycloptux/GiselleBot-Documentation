GiselleBot is a Discord bot, developed by Cyc (:fontawesome-brands-discord: cycloptux#1543). See also Need more help or stuck with something? Join our official Support Server on Discord! https://discord.gg/vY5zdmzukb GiselleBot was born as a \"small\" project to help the Brave Frontier-based Coalition (a group of people that played the same mobile game, Brave Frontier, from gumi Inc.) handle the kind-of-complicated (and fully documented, thanks to my friend and business partner NaviKing) members application workflow. Over time, a lot of side functions were added to help with day-to-day Discord usage, moderation, logging, roles management and so on. Nowadays, the bot is used on servers both large and small, official and unofficial. Built with security in mind, this actively developed bot is feature rich while still being flexible and easy to use. Key features include: Points based automatic and manual moderation system with half a dozen possible moderation actions, configurable rules list, and prompts to ensure moderators fill out every required piece of information on a warning for impeccable moderation documentation. Self assignable roles system that includes the ability to add roles to yourself via message reactions, not just bot commands! Configure groups of self assignable roles separately to require (or forbid) certain roles for obtaining them and set a minimum and maximum number of roles in each group Deep logging, including members, channels, roles, messages, server, voice, and moderation-related actions (including logging of deleted attachments) Social networks integrations, streaming tweets from Twitter to Discord in real-time (more integrations to come) New user management, including greet messages, automatically assigned roles, and automatically removed roles Permissions system to configure the usage of each module Social and currency system to allow users to rank up based on activity and earn currency to use on games in the bot Unique form builder module for creating guild applications, feedback surveys, bug reports, and so much more; all within Discord Unique Raid Room module to allow people to create and disband temporary voice and text channels for co-op (or competitive) gameplay Custom reactions: create your own commands with your own input and output text!

Server/Guild, Channel, Message, Role, User IDs Note: Each entity in Discord is mapped with a unique ID. Knowing what an ID is, and how to get the ID of a said entity is crucial to knowing how a bot works. Obtaining an ID also requires that you have Discord's Developer Mode active. There are a lot of guides and tutorials about how to activate Developer Mode and how to get an ID for an entity in Discord. This link will bring you to the official Discord support page about this topic. Obtaining a role ID may be trivial: you can obtain the role ID by prepending a role mention with \\ , but that message will still mention the role. In order to make your life easier, the bot offers a !roleid command. Parenthesis Parenthesis are used into command syntax snippets. The type of parenthesis indicates whether that parameter or string is mandatory, optional or just a simple description (hence, not an actual part of the command). Type Meaning () Mandatory [] Optional {} Description Names and Double Quotes Within the documentation, you may find the tag q_name in command syntax snippets. That's a short name for \"name surrounded by double quotes\", and is generally used for Discord user, channel or role plain names: Example \"cycloptux Development#1543\" \"Role With Spaces\" Time Format Code Standard Time Code Time is indicated through the use of a standard time format, which consists of 5 (or 6) time bits: Time Bit Meaning mo month(s) w week(s) d day(s) h hour(s) m minute(s) If specified, the time code may allow an extra bit, s for second(s). Each time bit has to be prepended with an actual (positive, integer) number, or omitted if the corresponding time bit would be set to 0. Important Note While some flexibility is allowed in time codes, be sure to write the time bits in the correct order: mo > w > d > h > m > s That said, a typical time code would be like this: 2mo6h40m = 2 months, 6 hours, 40 minutes Timestamp Mentions While the standard time code represents a time span (or duration) in an explicit form (e.g. 3 hours; 10 minutes from now; etc.), each command that supports a time code can also be used with a \"timestamp mention\" (refer to Message Formatting , \"Unix Timestamp\" or \"Unix Timestamp (Styled)\"). When using timestamp mentions as a time code replacement, will automatically convert the timestamp into the corresponding \"time from now\" interval to be used as time span. This may be particularly useful in some use cases when trying to trigger an action at a certain time of a day (e.g. reminders, repeating messages, scheduled commands, etc.). Tip You can easily create such timestamp mentions in a Discord-ready syntax using HammerTime by DJDavid98 .

Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements). Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. Do We Use Cookies And Other Tracking Technologies? In Short: No. We don\\'t use cookies, nor similar tracking technologies in our Website to access or store information. How Do We Handle Your Social Logins? In Short: If you choose to log in to our Services using your Discord account, we may have access to certain information about you. Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (specifically, your Discord account). We don\\'t specifically have an account management solution, nor will you ever have an \\\"account with us\\\". When a login procedure is needed to access our Services, you will be using your Discord account. When you do so, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider (Discord). The profile information we receive may vary, but will often include your username, profile picture, as well as other information Discord may choose to make public. We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps. Is Your Information Transferred Internationally? In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own. Our infrastructure is located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information, and in other countries. How Long Do We Keep Your Information? In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). For data related to the Forms module, submissions are saved for 12 months before being deleted from our database. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe? In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. Hereafter, you\\'ll find an exemplary and not exhaustive list of measures we implemented to keep your data safe: User Identification and Discord End User Data Processing: Wherever possible, the only identification key related to you that is stored on our system is your \\\"Discord ID\\\". Your \\\"Discord ID\\\" is a number provided by the Discord API and linked to your Discord End User Data. Your username, message content, data you provide to Discord, etc. is accessed by requesting such data through the Discord API using your Discord ID, while a minimal amount of data is stored in our Services. Encryption at Rest: Data stored by our Services is encrypted at rest (when saved in our database, or any data storage media we may be using) using best-in-class algorithms (e.g. AES-256-GCM) and following the most diffuse security guidelines. In some cases, data may be encrypted through multiple levels of encryption using different encryption keys; this approach is applied to all and any custom input we receive from the Discord API related to your Discord message content. Encryption in Transit: Data processed by our Services, or transferred between different components of our infrastructure, is encrypted using best-in-class algorithms (e.g. TLS 1.2+ with Mutual Authentication) and following the most diffuse security guidelines. Authentication, Authorization, Auditing: Our Services implement security measures that only allow authorized users to access any stored data. Infrastructure Security: Data is segregated into different components of the infrastructure that provides our Services. Technical and organizational security measures are in place to minimize the chance of an intruder having access to our infrastructure. What Are Your Privacy Rights? In Short: By choosing GDPR as our privacy framework, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. Multiple privacy frameworks may be applied when storing and processing your data. We chose to align with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), extending those rights to you independently of where you are. In \\\"GDPR terminology\\\", as referred in Article 4, we often refer to the following concept: Data Subject: any identifiable natural person whose personal data may be accessed, stored, and processed (in other words, you); Data Controller: determines the purposes for which and the means by which personal data is processed; Data Processor: processes personal data only on behalf of the controller; We are a Data Controller of the information you provide to us, and a Data Processor of the Discord End User Data we are provided by the Discord API. According to the GDPR, in certain circumstances (Chapter 3), you may have the following data protection rights: The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you. The right of rectification. The right to object. The right of restriction. The right to data portability. The right to withdraw consent. In circumstances where these rights may apply, you may request the application of such rights. To make such a request, you may email us at privacy@discomm.cc detailing your inquiry. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. Upon receiving your request, we may need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts may require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. In such cases, we will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you. How Can You Opt-Out Of Providing Your Data? In Short: Our Services may offer the ability to self opt-out of providing your data. When this option is not available, you may contact us to have your situation examined. Under certain circumstances, you may decide to opt-out of providing your data to us or, in other words, request us to have your personal information deleted from our Services. Depending on the personal information we collect, store, and process, and the specific Service we are offering to you, you may be able to self opt-out of providing some, or all, data. In relation to the data that we collect, store, and process, you may have the following options regarding the ability to opt-out, or have your data deleted: Discord ID: Opting out of providing your Discord ID may not be possible in all circumstances. Your Discord ID is, in a general way, not a specific personal information unless it\\'s matched with other personal information that is collected, stored, and processed by Discord. You may refer to the Discord privacy policies and terms of service to know how to opt-out of providing your Discord ID. Partial Discord Message Content: In regard to the content of messages that let you directly interact with our Bot, such as when using commands, you may self opt-out of all occasions where you provided us with any custom input by disabling, or properly reconfiguring, such features that were configured using custom inputs. Full Discord Message Content: In regard to the content of messages that you send using the Discord App, even when the message is not related to a direct interaction with our Bot, you may (or may not) have the ability to self opt-out of providing your data depending on the technical implementation of such features that access your full message content. You may refer to the technical documentation of our Services for more information about whether this ability is provided. Other Identifiers: When directly interacting with us, you may request your personal information to be deleted at any time during our interaction. In case where such request is made, we may not be able to provide you with the information, or Service, you are requesting from us. Other Discord End User Data: In regard to other types of content we may obtain through the Discord API, you may refer to the Discord privacy policies and terms of service to know how to opt-out of providing such data. In all cases where self opt-out is not an option, you may email us at privacy@discomm.cc detailing your inquiry. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Do We Make Updates To This Policy? In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated \\\"Last Revised\\\" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a policy of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. To What Extent Does This Policy Apply? (a.k.a. Third-Party Privacy Policies) In Short: While we do our best to keep our providers under observation, you are advised to refer to their respective privacy policies for further details. Our Services are based on both self-developed and self-managed assets, and assets that are provided to us by external third-party providers. In choosing our providers, we assess their technical and organizational policies and choose those that preserve your privacy according to valid policies.

Present in ~10,000 Discord servers, reaching ~7.8M users. Development started in September, 2017. GiselleBot turned from being a private bot into a public bot in March 2018. Since December 2019, GiselleBot has handled over 870,000 successful commands, with an average of ~1,200 commands per day. Infrastructure The bot is hosted on GalaxyGate. The infrastructure is currently composed of 5 main components: 1 Web Server, hosting the documentation website and the API gateway used to communicate with the bots(s) from the external world. 1 Application Server, hosting the bot itself. 1 Application Server, hosting the supporting microservices. 3 MongoDB machines, forming a high-availability Replica Set. 3 Redis instances, forming a high-availability set managed through Redis Sentinel. Redis is used a high performance in-memory cache for the most used DB queries. The instances are hosted on the same servers that host MongoDB, but the Primary instance of each datastore is on different servers at any time. Other than the plain computing power, from GalaxyGate, some PaaS services are provided by Amazon Web Services: Object Storage buckets, hosting the temporary (encrypted) files that are sent to end-users via a variety of commands. A centralized log management system. A Key Management System / Secrets Manager, storing the secret keys and API keys used by the bot. Private keys and/or credentials are never stored on the actual servers, they are fetched during the startup of each service. A DNS managed service, hosting the public cycloptux.com and gisellebot.com domains, the short gisl.eu domain and the internal private domain. Security Regarding the security aspects of the bot, here's a list of features that have been implemented: Encryption in Transit Internal network communications between all infrastructure components only happen on a private network (VLAN) specifically instanced by the hosting provider, and never go through the internet.pplication server, web server, microservices and DB machines are encrypted using SSL/TLS (specifically, TLS 1.1+) encryption, with 2-way forced validation of server and client certificates. Network connections between the API gateway and the application server and microservices are encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) encryption, with forced 2-way validation of server and client certificates. The certificates used to encrypt data in transit are released by an internal Certificate Authority (which is on a different hosting provider, and powered off when not in use, to protect its keys). The certificates are signed by an intermediate CA which then points at the root CA, so that the root CA key is never used and the intermediate CA can be killed if compromised. The web server and API gateway are only exposed to the internet through HTTPS (HSTS). The web access itself is protected through Cloudflare . The network connection between Cloudflare and the actual web server is also protected by strict HTTPS using automatically renewed certificates signed by Let\\'s Encrypt . Encryption at Rest All storage media (hard disks, object storage repositories, etc.) are protected through low-level encryption. Potentially sensitive and personal data (basically, anything that can be assimilated to a string) stored in the database is encrypted using military-grade AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM algorithms. Commands that generate big files (such as a chat log) may transmit the file to the user via Direct Message by temporarily storing it into an encrypted Object Storage bucket. The archive itself is also encrypted using 7-Zip\\'s encryption algorithm, based on AES-256. The password is purposefully never logged into the bot internal logs and is only known to the end user. As an extra layer of security, users can decide to delete the bot\\'s message so that the password is also removed from Discord itself. Refer to deletedm for more info. The retention for these files is currently set to 30 days. Authentication, Authorization, Auditing SSH access to the infrastructure is only available from within the internal network. The internal network can be accessed through a hardened bastion VPN endpoint. SSH access to the virtual servers is protected via private keys and, in some cases, multifactor authentication. Sensitive information needed by the microservices are either fetched from the KMS when the microservice starts, or passed through temporary environmental variables. Every access and action is logged, both in the API gateway and in the application server. All bot commands are logged. The API offered by the bots are not directly accessed from the internet. The API gateway acts as a bridge, and implements a fully fledged authentication and authorization workflow used to create and distribute temporary tokens to the end users. Further authorization checks are applied on the specific API calls to restrict \"authorized\" users from requesting data that doesn't belong to them. Infrastructure Security Each host is protected by a local firewall, making sure that only the required ports are open. The SSH service is not exposed to the internet. Infrastructure management portals are protected by strong passwords and multifactor authentication. Encryption keys, secret access keys, secret tokens, credentials, etc. are never stored into local drives. An external Key Management System (KMS) is used to fetch secret keys at runtime. The database is backed up every 12 hours, and the retention policy for backup files is set to keep backups on a highly available Object Storage repository for at least 30 days. The source code for the bot, and all of its related dependencies, is stored in private Git-based repositories.","title":"Technical & Security Background"},{"location":"Contents/Technical%20%26%20Security%20Background/#technical-security-background","text":"Last Revised: November 15, 2021","title":"Technical &amp; Security Background"},{"location":"Contents/Technical%20%26%20Security%20Background/#core-engine","text":"The bot is written in Node.js, and uses Discord.js v13 as core Discord library.

The game was released in 4 regions/versions: CN (Chinese) JP (Japanese) KR (Korean) EN (English/Global) Commands azurstatus Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} azurstatus [--region {region code}] ::: Command Description Checks the status of Azur Lane\\'s game servers. Omitting the region code will assume --region en and show the status of the (4, at the time of writing this page) English servers. The Chinese region will print 2 embeds: one for the Android servers, one for the iOS servers. Other regions have common servers among the 2 platforms. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} azurstatus azurstatus --region cn ::: Server Status Live Feed The Azur Lane Server Status Feed offers an easy way to monitor Azur Lane servers availability for any region , and be notified when something changes on one (or more) of the webhooks configured in your Discord server. ::: {.seealso} In order to better understand this module, it\\'s very important that you are familiar with Discord webhooks. For more details about this Discord feature, please take a look at this official guide . ::: By default, the status feed mascot will be the Azur Lane character (ship) San Diego , and all of the feed messages will be Azur Lane-themed. The full list of feed messages and monitored transitions can be found in this Google Spreadsheet . Each message will be followed by a list of hashtags, that users may use to filter the specific messages they are interested into, indicating: The region code whom the message refers to: #cn #en #jp #kr The current status of the region, using a technical status tag: #gateway_error #full_offline #partial_offline #operational One or more server name tags, indicating the specific impacted servers: e.g. #avrora #lexington ... The quote ID (refer to the Azur Lane Server Status Feed Sentences Google Spreadsheet ) for the region status transition and/or server status transition: e.g. #r_01 #r_02 s_02 ... {.align-center width=\"600px\"} azurhook Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} azurhook (webhook URL or --channel (channel id/mention/q_name)) [customization params] ::: Command Description Starts a live feed on the specified webhook. When a new transition is found, its notification will be sent to the specified webhook service. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack 2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message containing any kind of content using external tools and send that message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare) occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the --channel (channel id/mention/q_name) parameter: a new dedicated webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be automatically used for this feed. This alternative option requires to have \\\"Manage Webhooks\\\" permissions. ::: Customization Params --region (first region code) [second region code] [...] Adds a whitelist , inclusive filter for Azur Lane server regions to the stream. Transitions that are referring to (one of) the selected region(s) will be sent to the webhook, while the rest will be skipped. This parameter only supports these region codes: cn en jp kr Region codes are case-insensitive. Default : No filter (all regions) --filter (first word) [second word] [...] Adds a whitelist filter to the feed. In this example, if the status quote contains first word and/or (see below) second word , the submission will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You can set one or more words, case-insensitive. This is especially effective if you are using the provided hashtags to filter specific events of interest. You can also set \\\"composite words\\\" (two or more words as a single filter) by quoting them: \"foo bar\" test will count as 2 filter elements: foo bar and test .

Supported Triggers Server Invites : recognizes Discord server invites in user messages; this trigger supports shortened URLs (e.g. Discord invites hidden behind a bit.ly/gisl.eu shortening service), and ignores invites pointing to the current server. Anti-Phishing : recognizes known phishing domains in user messages; this trigger supports shortened URLs (e.g. phishing domains hidden behind a bit.ly/gisl.eu shortening service). The list is updated on an hourly basis with new domains, and powered by cactus#0523\\'s phishing domains list. Mass Mention : counts the number of mentions (roles, users or everyone/here) sent by a user, in a channel, within a certain span of time and triggers if the number of mentions is over a threshold. The default (allowed) threshold pair is 5 mentions in 30 seconds, but can be configured in each server. Banned Words : checks the message against a list of words, configured by the user, and triggers if one or more words are found within the message. Punctuation and letter case are ignored. The parser can be configured to trigger on an \\\"exact match\\\" (e.g. banned word: test , matching word: test ), if the banned word is found at the \\\"beginning of a word\\\" within the message (e.g. banned word: test , matching word: testing ), or \\\"anywhere in word\\\" (e.g. banned word: test , matching word: attestation ).

Anti-Emoji Spam : counts the number of emojis sent by a user, in a channel, within a certain span of time (native or custom, in one or more messages) and triggers if the number of emojis is over a threshold. The default (allowed) threshold pair is 5 attachments in 10 seconds, but can be configured in each server. Anti-Attachment Spam : counts the number of attachments sent by a user, in a channel, within a certain span of time and triggers if the number of attachments is over a threshold. The default (allowed) threshold pair is 5 attachments in 10 seconds, but can be configured in each server. NSFW Images : recognizes possible NSFW images sent by posting URLs in a message, or using message attachments, and triggers if at least one of the images posted is over the NSFW threshold for the server. Refer to nsfwjs for a deeper explanation of this detection system, and to nsfwthreshold to configure the server threshold. QR Codes : recognizes QR codes contained in images sent by posting URLs in a message, or using message attachments, and triggers if at least one of the images posted is confirmed to contain a QR code. This check works on both screenshots and pictures (taken by a camera/webcam), even though the recognition rate of pictures may be affected by the quality of the image. Anti-Raid : counts the number of users (either new, or existing users leaving and re-joining) joining your server within a certain span of time and triggers if the number server joins is over a threshold. The default (allowed) threshold pair is 5 users in 15 seconds, but can be configured in each server.

For more details about this Discord feature, please take a look at this official guide . ::: By default, each new post will be posted to the webhook by using the Instagram account username as author, and the account profile icon (if present) as Discord profile picture. These settings (and other details) can be customized for each stream. Instagram post URLs will be posted to Discord, while the submission preview will leverage the native parsing of Instagram content offered by Discord (not available at the time of writing this page, but you can use custom header tags to show more info on each post). This module will only work on public accounts . ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: The goal of this module is offering a free alternative to something that is usually only achieved through the use of paid services. On the other hand, due to limitations that are applied to the Instagram API, this module might suffer from delays (new posts will be checked every 1\\~3 hours , and users\\' info may take up to 24 hours to be refreshed) and/or miss a few posts in high-traffic accounts ( the module will only catch up to 50 new posts in each check window ). ::: instahook Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} instahook (Instagram username) (webhook URL or --channel (channel id/mention/q_name)) [customization params] ::: Command Description Starts a streaming service for the selected Instagram account. If a new submission is found, it will be sent to the specified webhook service. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack 2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message containing any kind of content using external tools and send that message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare) occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the --channel (channel id/mention/q_name) parameter: a new dedicated webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be automatically used for this feed. This alternative option requires to have \\\"Manage Webhooks\\\" permissions. ::: Customization Params --filter (first word) [second word] [...] Adds a whitelist filter to the stream. In this example, if the post caption contains first word and/or (see below) second word , the submission will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You can set one or more words, case-insensitive. You can also set \\\"composite words\\\" (two or more words as a single filter) by quoting them: \"foo bar\" test will count as 2 filter elements: foo bar and test . The filter works on partial words (e.g. \\\"announce\\\" will work on both \\\"announcement\\\" and \\\"announced\\\"). Default : No filter --mode (AND/OR) Sets the filter behavior when more than 1 word is added to the whitelist filter. AND will only allow submissions that contain all of the filtered words. OR will allow submissions that cointain at least one of the filtered words. Default : OR --include or --exclude Sets the filter behavior one or more words are added to the whitelist filter. --include will only allow submissions that contain the filtered word(s). --exclude will only allow submissions that do not contain the filtered word(s). These parameters will work together with --mode (AND/OR) , allowing the Instagram connector to filter based on INCLUDING the filter items (e.g., at least one filter item (OR) or all filter items (AND) are included in the submission) or EXCLUDING filter items (e.g., post if all filter items are absent from the submission (AND) or at least one filter item is absent from the submission (OR)).

These settings (and other details) can be customized for each stream. Twitch profile URLs will be posted to Discord, while the Twitch stream preview will leverage the native parsing of Twitch content offered by Discord. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Due to inconsistencies and limitations within the Twitch API, this module may have some extra delay between the actual event and the Discord notification, and/or miss a few notifications every once in a while, and/or send duplicate notifications. Additional checks are in place to minimize the amount occurrencies of duplicate notifications. ::: twchook Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} twchook (Twitch username) (webhook URL or --channel (channel id/mention/q_name)) [customization params] ::: Command Description Starts a notification service for the selected Twitch account. If a user starts or ends a Live stream a notification will be sent to the specified webhook service. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack 2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message containing any kind of content using external tools and send that message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare) occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the --channel (channel id/mention/q_name) parameter: a new dedicated webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be automatically used for this feed. This alternative option requires to have \\\"Manage Webhooks\\\" permissions. ::: Customization Params --game (first game) [second game] [...] Adds a whitelist , inclusive filter for game names to the service. Notifications for the selected user will only be sent if the streamed game is equal to one of the filtered games. Actions related to other games will be skipped. You can also set \\\"composite words\\\" (two or more words as a single game name) by quoting them: \"league of legends\" fortnite will count as 2 game filter elements: league of legends and fortnite . All filters are case-insensitive, but the game name has to be exact for the filter to work correctly. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: This parameter will only work for games that are set at the beginning of a stream. Changing the game throughout a stream will not trigger the additional \\\"Live\\\" notification. ::: Default : No filter --event (first event) [second event] [...] Adds a whitelist , inclusive filter for specific events to the service. Notifications will only be sent if the actual notification event is equal to one of the filtered events. The only supported events for this feed are: live , corresponding to Twitch users going live on a game; offline , corresponding to Twitch users ending their stream. Default : No filter --header (message) Adds a custom header message when notifications are posted. Custom headers can have a maximum of 1024 characters. Custom headers can be formatted as embeds by following a very specific syntax. Do know that both and Discord are very sensitive to this specific syntax, which is easily \\\"broken\\\" by special characters: for this reason, using embeds as header is not suggested, nor directly supported. Use them at your own risk! If you are brave enough, I suggest the usage of this embed generator (click on the \\\"Enable webhook mode\\\" button at the bottom of the page). Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their respective \\\"real\\\" value during run-time. These are: %display_name% : This will be replaced with the display name of an account, including proper formatting of letter cases (e.g. Cycloptux ) %username% : This will be replaced with the \\\"URL\\\" username of a Twitch user (typically, lowercase). E.g. cycloptux %game% : This will be replaced with the name of the streamed game (e.g. Fortnite ) %status% : This will be replaced with the description that is usually added below a game title during a stream. %stream_status% : This will be replaced with one of the two values: Live upon a \\\"going Live\\\" notification, Offline upon a stream end. %timestamp% or %timestamp_utc% : This will be replaced with the UTC time of the start of the event, with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC) . %timestamp_iso% : This will be replaced with the UTC time of the start of the event, as ISO8601 string. %timestamp_pst% : This will be replaced with the current PST time of the start of the event, with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST) . %url% : This will be replaced with the Twitch profile URL. See below for more info. Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the utc part with either: A different valid time zone identifier: use the searchtz command to look for a valid time zone name. An UTC offset , in the form of [UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes] . Here are some valid examples: %timestamp_Europe/London% %timestamp_America/Los_Angeles% %timestamp_Japan% %timestamp_PST8PDT% %timestamp_+0800% %timestamp_-10:30% %timestamp_UTC+2% By default, without an explicit use of %url% , all headers will be followed by the actual Twitch profile URL on a new line; rendering of that URL will be done by Discord. If the %url% parameter is used, the default URL will not be appended to the custom header. The default header has two different modes for online and offline. Setting a custom header will use the header on both messages: make use of the %stream_status% tag to differentiate between the two messages. Default : :red_circle: Now Live on Twitch: %display_name% | :video_game: Playing %game%. and Stream Offline: %display_name% | :video_game: Playing %game%. --webhook-name (custom name) Adds a custom username to the webhook when notifications are sent. Custom usernames can have a maximum of 32 characters. Default : New notifications will be sent by a webhook with the display name of the Twitch account --no-username-overwrite Removes any custom name from the webhook.

These dynamic placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding value if the runtime value is present/applicable, or deleted if they are not applicable. These three tags are: %media_url% : This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet, each one on a new line. %media_all_url_if_multiple% : This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet, each one on a new line, only if there\\'s more than 1 media in the tweet . %media_extra_url_if_multiple% : This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet minus the first one , each one on a new line, only if there\\'s more than 1 media in the tweet . By default, the first media on a tweet is shown in the default Discord preview of the tweet.

The Q/As can be set up to be a sequence of multi-choice or open questions, with the final output (submission) being sent into a server channel by the bot itself for further validation, priority assignment and optional integration with external services. (Optional features) Upon accepting a submission, a submission summary can be forwarded as a read-only post to a different channel and can be automatically given an \\\"upvote\\\" and \\\"downvote\\\" reaction for people to show their support (or lack thereof) to the specific submission. Currently, each form submission can be configured to remain within the Discord realm, or uploaded to Trello (a powerful web-based, list-making application) as a \\\"Trello card\\\" (\\\"share mode\\\"). Trello integration also includes the 2-way synchronization of upvotes/downvotes and comments number from and to Discord and Trello (showing the number of upvotes and downvotes on the Trello card, as well as showing the current number of Trello comments and votes on the Discord message), and Discord DM notifications to the author of the submission upon Trello card activities (new comments, title changes, card archival, etc.). ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: For the Trello integration to work, some limitations currently apply: You must invite to your Trello team and give it permissions to edit the board in order for the bot to monitor, post and update cards.

Each Discord server can only be paired with 1 Trello team. Form settings will be fixed once a user sends a submission. Any change to a form will not apply to submissions that are already in the approval queue. This also means that the Trello board must be set (thus, exist) before a submission is sent. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Users that are enabled to use the module using the permissions will always be authorized to accept or reject any submission coming from any form. In order to enable more roles to accept/reject specific forms, you can set one or more roles as \\\"authorized roles\\\" on each form both during the initial setup of the form and through the formsetup command. ::: ::: {.admonition} Premium Out of the box, each server is limited to having a total of 3 available forms . If you want to remove this limitation and have up to 20 forms, you can unlock the number of forms as a Premium feature (see: premium-perks ). ::: ::: {.hint} ::: {.title} Hint ::: In order to ease the creation of the complex strings you need to add questions to a form, you can use this Forms Builder Helper to create pre-made strings to be used in those phases. Just create a copy of that sheet and customize it to your needs. ::: trellopair Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} trellopair [team name/URL, or \\\"-\\\"] ::: Command Description Pairs a Discord server with a Trello team. No restrictions are applied to the number of Discord servers that can pair a Trello team, although each server must pass the verification step individually (see below). In order to pair with a team, you can use the team name or the URL containing the team name (see the note below). Using the command without any argument will show the current paired Trello team. Using - as the only argument will unpair the current server from the paired Trello team. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: The team name is the one you find inside the Trello URL within the team page, which usually has this form: https://trello.com/TEAM_NAME/home ::: As a security measure, the Trello team pairing process is composed of 2 steps. Running this command will issue a verification request to the target Trello team, giving the user who run the command a 6-digits unique code (that is generated randomly when the command is run). You must then verify that you have enough permissions to create cards on at least one Team board before the pairing is effective. will start querying the Trello team boards in order to find a card with the 6-digits code set as title. You must head to one of the Team boards and create a card (in any list) with the provided 6-digits code as title . If no card is found with the correct title within 5 minutes from running the command, the pairing will fail. If the card is found, the pairing will complete and the team boards will be available for use in the Forms module. Once the card is found the pairing will complete, actvating the integration. The verification card will be deleted, and you will be notified (with a mention) in the current channel.

In that case, will start the submission by showing a list of servers the user can select. If used within an actual server, it will make send a DM to the user running the command, showing the available forms for the specific server the command was run into. When the command is used in \\'s DMs, the list of available servers is taken from \\'s current cache. If the server you are looking for does not appear, use the submit command from within that server. This command is not subject to any permissions other than a specific blacklist check (see formblacklist). The actual form submission must always happen though \\'s DMs. ::: submitreact Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreact [--m {message id}] ::: Command Description Other than sending the submit command to via DM, or using it in a server to quickly start the DM workflow, authorized people can enable a specific reaction on a message of choice (or a message created by for that purpose) to have send the initial form submission DM to the user clicking on the reaction. This command starts a simple interactive process to build this \\\"submit reaction message\\\". will guide you through the process of creating this reaction, just follow the in-Discord instructions. If a valid message ID is specified through the dedicated parameter, the submit reaction will be created on the target message. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreact submitreact --m 123456789098765432 ::: submitreactremove Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreactremove [message id] ::: Command Description Removes the submit reaction behavior from an existing message. The message itself won\\'t be deleted, nor the existing reactions will be removed, but will now not do anything with the reaction on that message. If the message ID is omitted (or is invalid), will attempt to pick the latest submit reaction message in the current channel. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreactremove 123456789098765432 ::: adsubmit Command Description Toggles the automatic deletion of the \\\"confirmation\\\" message that is sent upon using the submit command into a server, and of the command itself. The user-sent message will be deleted immediately. The confirmation message will be deleted after 5 seconds. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Messages | Bot : Manage Messages forminit Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} foinit ::: Command Description Initializes a new form builder. The bot will guide the user into setting up the basic configurations and first question. Forms questions will expire after: 5 minutes, for reaction questions; 15 minutes, for open questions. The format to set a form question is: ::: {.parsed-literal} (message/reaction)(list of reactions)/[validation words][Trello mapping] ::: Each question has to be set using 5 fields, separated by one | character. First field: message will require the question to be answered with a plain text message. reaction will require the user to select one answer by clicking on a reaction that will be added to the question by the bot. Second field: The actual question. Third field: If reaction is selected in the first field, this field will list all of the possible answers, using ; to separate these answers. If this is the case, this field is mandatory . If message is selected in the first field, this field will include a list of validation words: any answer given by the target user will be ignored unless the message contains at least one of the chosen words/sentences (case insensitive). Again, you can separate words/sentences with ; . If this is the case, this field is optional. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Due to Discord limitations, there can only be a maximum of 20 answers in a reaction question. Answers from the 21st onward will be ignored. ::: Fourth field: The question \\\"alias\\\". This is the title that will replace the full question when the feedback is posted in the server channel. This field is optional, but it\\'s higly suggested that you set an alias. Fifth field: This will map the question into one of the entities of the Trello board. While private and attachment have a meaning in in-Discord share mode (see formsetup), the rest is only useful if you are interested in Trello integration; you can choose whether or not including Trello integration later: title will use the answer as the title of a card. list will use the answer as the title of a list. label will add the answer as a card label. attachment will add the answer as a card attachment. If the \\\"attachments highlighting\\\" option is active, fields flagged as attachment will also appear in the public in-Discord summary message. description will add the answer as part of the description text, with the format: {Alias}: {Text} . private will show the answer into the \\\"in-Discord\\\" embed during the authorization process but won\\'t upload the field to Trello (or show it in the public in-Discord summary message) whatsoever. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: A field being \\\"optional\\\" means that its content can be left blank, but the field itself has to exist; e.g. message|Heads or Tails?||The user picked...| ::: ::: {.hint} ::: {.title} Hint ::: In order to ease the creation of these complex strings, you can use this Forms Builder Helper to create a pre-made string to be used in this phase. Just create a copy of that sheet and customize it to your needs. ::: formsetup Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} foset (form id) ::: Command Description Opens the forms builder interactive configuration menu. Use the menu items to configure the available settings. {.align-center width=\"400px\"} Options 1. and 2. are used to save the settings you applied through the menu (the settings will not apply until you save them), or discard said changes. \\\"Set title\\\" sets the title of the form, as it appears when listed by . \\\"Set color\\\" sets the form embeds color. \\\"Set authorization channel\\\" sets the channel where form submissions are sent to for the initial validation by the authorized users. This option is mandatory. \\\"Set forwarding channel(s)\\\" sets the additional forwarding channels where, if set, the public in-Discord summary message will be sent to. This is optional. \\\"Set authorized role(s)\\\" sets the list of roles that will be both authorized to accept and reject submissions to the current form, and mentioned (optional, see option 18) within the authorization channel when a submission is received. \\\"Toggle share mode\\\" sets the final target of a validated submission to either Trello, or just Discord. \\\"Toggle publish status\\\" works as an alias of formpublish and formwithhold to make a form available or unavailable for server members through \\'s DMs. \\\"Toggle upvoting\\\" enables or disables the upvote tracking feature (and upvote arrow application for new submissions) on a specific form. \\\"Toggle downvoting\\\" enables or disables the downvote tracking feature (and downvote arrow application for new submissions) on a specific form. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Disabling a voting arrow will not remove the :arrow_up: and/or :arrow_down: reaction from existing submissions, but it will stop those submissions\\' votes from being tracked in Trello (if you are using the Trello share mode). New submissions will not have the corresponding arrow reaction applied. Enabling a previously disabled voting arrow will not reapply the arrow to existing submissions. It will track the votes as long as any user adds the :arrow_up: and/or :arrow_down: reaction to the public submission message (as long as it\\'s the native Discord reaction and not a custom one). ::: \\\"Toggle highlighting of attachments\\\" enables or disables the public embed from having an additional field where all of the \\\"attachment\\\"-flagged fields are linked, using their gisl.eu short link (using the same engine behind shorturl ). \\\"Set mentioned role(s)\\\" sets the list of roles that will be mentioned in the public in-Discord summary message(s) when a submission is accepted. (Only useful in \\\"Trello share mode\\\") \\\"Set target board\\\" lists the available boards within the paired Trello team (refer to trellopair ) and sets the linked Trello board for the current form. Renaming a board in Trello will not affect this link. (Only useful in \\\"Trello share mode\\\") \\\"Toggle extended embed\\\" enables or disabled the public in-Discord summary message extended mode: by default, a submission that has Trello set as \\\"share mode\\\" will only show a short summary of the submission, while the actual full post will be found in the linked Trello card. By enabling the \\\"extended embed\\\", the whole submission will be kept within Discord, while still having a link to the corresponding Trello card. (Only useful in \\\"Discord share mode\\\" or \\\"Trello share mode\\\" with \\\"extended embed\\\" active) \\\"Anonymize public submissions\\\" completely hides the submitter info from the public in-Discord summary message, keeping the user\\'s anonymity intact (as long as \\\"private\\\"-flagged fields are used for other kinds of recognizable data within the form). \\\"Anonymize rejection messages\\\" enables or disables whether the name of the user that rejected a submission will appear in the rejection message on a specific form. \\\"Mention the authorized role(s) on new submissions\\\" toggles whether the authorized role(s) will be mentioned when a new submission is received. \\\"Toggle priority reactions\\\" toggles whether the priority reactions are applied to the validation message. When this option is off, the only options will be \\\"Pass (No Priority)\\\" and \\\"Drop\\\". Here\\'s an example of a public in-Discord summary message with Trello share mode, extended embed, attachments highlighting and anonymizer on. {.align-center width=\"600px\"} formaddqst Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} foaq (form id) ::: Command Description Adds a question to an existing form.

Its best use case is giving a place to small groups of people that need to talk to each other privately for a short amount of time, then disband the group to later re-form another one with different people. A similar situation can be achieved by setting up a private group DM, with the downsides of: Having to befriend all those that are involved in the group DM (this is only true for the creator of the group DM). Not having access to bots. Not having any kind of moderation or 3rd party control over what happens in the group DM. In order to preserve the privacy of the group, each raid room will be assigned with a PIN that will only be shared with the room master (whoever created the room). Other users will only be able to enter the room by knowing the PIN code, or being invited by the room master. Each user can create a maximum of 2 rooms at the same time on a server: 1 text and 1 voice rooms. Each raid room will expire after a set amount of time, as defined by the user (a soft cap can be set by the mods/admins). When that happens, the channel is automatically deleted. Warning messages will be sent to the room master before that happens. When a text raid room expires, a chat log is dumped and saved (encrypted). The chat log will be posted into the raid rooms logger channel (see first-setup ). One or more roles can be set as \\\"supervisor\\\" roles. Supervisors will have moderation powers over raid rooms, similar to how moderators have powers over the rest of the server (see supervisor-commands ). ::: {.admonition} Premium Out of the box, each server is limited to having a total of 5 simultaneous Raid Rooms .

Its output is focused on highlighting reactions that are added by Discord accounts that have been recently created, in order to perform a better analysis of potential \\\"fraudulent votes\\\": duplicate reactions added by newly created accounts just for the sake of increasing one\\'s message\\'s reactions. The --age and --joined parameters will define how to recognize a suspect user: --age defines the minimum age of the Discord account to avoid being flagged. --joined defines the minimum amount of time the user needs to be on the server to avoid being flagged. The --members parameter, on the other hand, defines the minimum number of members needed to pass both checks for a message to be flagged as having fraudulent reaction votes. As a practical example: ::: {.parsed-literal} recontest 50 --age 1w --joined 3d --members 5 ::: would flag any messages, within the last 50 messages in the current channel, with more than 5 (unique) members that have reacted to the message with a Discord account that is less than 1 week old and that joined the server less than 3 days ago . If the number of messages is omitted, the bot will scan the latest 10 messages. Omitting --age and/or --joined parameters will disable the corresponding check from being relevant in recognizing fraudulent votes (e.g. omitting --age will mark any account as suspect, regardless of its actual Discord age). Omitting the --members parameter will set its default value of 0, making every message with at least 1 suspect member being flagged as fraudulent.

The --age and --joined parameters will define how to recognize a suspect user: --age defines the minimum age of the Discord account to avoid being flagged. --joined defines the minimum amount of time the user needs to be on the server to avoid being flagged. The --members parameter, on the other hand, defines the minimum number of members needed to pass both checks for a message to be flagged as having fraudulent reaction votes. As a practical example: ::: {.parsed-literal} recontest 50 --age 1w --joined 3d --members 5 ::: would flag any messages, within the last 50 messages in the current channel, with more than 5 (unique) members that have reacted to the message with a Discord account that is less than 1 week old and that joined the server less than 3 days ago . If the number of messages is omitted, the bot will scan the latest 10 messages. Omitting --age and/or --joined parameters will disable the corresponding check from being relevant in recognizing fraudulent votes (e.g. omitting --age will mark any account as suspect, regardless of its actual Discord age). Omitting the --members parameter will set its default value of 0, making every message with at least 1 suspect member being flagged as fraudulent. Using the --csv parameter instructs to send 2 .csv files to the command author: A .csv with the same output of resummary, showing the list of messages with reactions within the last # of messages in the current channel, including the list of reactions and number of uses per each reaction. This is further enhanced with a \\\"Fraudulent Flag\\\" and a \\\"Fraudulent Votes\\\" extra column. A 2nd .csv with the list of users that meet that \\\"Fraudulent Votes\\\" criteria, with a separate record for each message they reacted to (including how they reacted to the message). Using the --silent parameter suppresses the in-channel embed output (this only works if used with --csv ).

When delaying a command, the permission checks for the target command will be checked both during the first scheduling request, and then re-checked at run-time.

Failing either checks will reject the command run (either by not letting the user schedule the command at all, or failing at run-time).

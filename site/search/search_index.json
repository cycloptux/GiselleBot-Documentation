GiselleBot is a Discord bot, developed by Cyc ( cycloptux#1543). Questions? Need more help or stuck with something? Join our official Support Server on Discord! https://discord.gg/vY5zdmzukb GiselleBot was born as a \"small\" project to help the Brave Frontier-based Coalition (a group of people that played the same mobile game, Brave Frontier, from gumi Inc.) handle the kind-of-complicated (and fully documented, thanks to my friend and business partner NaviKing) members application workflow. Over time, a lot of side functions were added to help with day-to-day Discord usage, moderation, logging, roles management and so on. Nowadays, the bot is used on servers both large and small, official and unofficial. Built with security in mind, this actively developed bot is feature rich while still being flexible and easy to use. Key features include: Points based automatic and manual moderation system with half a dozen possible moderation actions, configurable rules list, and prompts to ensure moderators fill out every required piece of information on a warning for impeccable moderation documentation. Self assignable roles' system that includes the ability to add roles to yourself via message reactions, not just bot commands! Configure groups of self assignable roles separately to require (or forbid) certain roles for obtaining them and set a minimum and maximum number of roles in each group Deep logging, including members, channels, roles, messages, server, voice, and moderation-related actions (including logging of deleted attachments) Social networks integrations, streaming tweets from Twitter to Discord in real-time (more integrations to come) New user management, including greet messages, automatically assigned roles, and automatically removed roles Permissions system to configure the usage of each module Social and currency system to allow users to rank up based on activity and earn currency to use on games in the bot Unique form builder module for creating guild applications, feedback surveys, bug reports, and so much more; all within Discord Unique Raid Room module to allow people to create and disband temporary voice and text channels for co-op (or competitive) gameplay Custom reactions: create your own commands with your own input and output text!

Server/Guild, Channel, Message, Role, User IDs Note: Each entity in Discord is mapped with a unique ID. Knowing what an ID is, and how to get the ID of a said entity is crucial to knowing how a bot works. Obtaining an ID also requires that you have Discord's Developer Mode active. There are a lot of guides and tutorials about how to activate Developer Mode and how to get an ID for an entity in Discord. This link will bring you to the official Discord support page about this topic. Obtaining a role ID may be trivial: you can obtain the role ID by prepending a role mention with \\ , but that message will still mention the role. In order to make your life easier, the bot offers a !roleid command. Parenthesis Parenthesis are used into command syntax snippets. The type of parenthesis indicates whether that parameter or string is mandatory, optional or just a simple description (hence, not an actual part of the command). Type Meaning () Mandatory [] Optional {} Description Names and Double Quotes Within the documentation, you may find the tag q_name in command syntax snippets. That's a short name for \"name surrounded by double quotes\", and is generally used for Discord user, channel or role plain names: Example \"cycloptux Development#1543\" \"Role With Spaces\" Time Format Code Standard Time Code Time is indicated through the use of a standard time format, which consists of 5 (or 6) time bits: Time Bit Meaning mo month(s) w week(s) d day(s) h hour(s) m minute(s) If specified, the time code may allow an extra bit, s for second(s). Each time bit has to be prepended with an actual (positive, integer) number, or omitted if the corresponding time bit would be set to 0. Important Note While some flexibility is allowed in time codes, be sure to write the time bits in the correct order: mo > w > d > h > m > s That said, a typical time code would be like this: 2mo6h40m = 2 months, 6 hours, 40 minutes Timestamp Mentions While the standard time code represents a time span (or duration) in an explicit form (e.g. 3 hours; 10 minutes from now; etc.), each command that supports a time code can also be used with a \"timestamp mention\" (refer to Message Formatting , \"Unix Timestamp\" or \"Unix Timestamp (Styled)\"). When using timestamp mentions as a time code replacement, will automatically convert the timestamp into the corresponding \"time from now\" interval to be used as time span. This may be particularly useful in some use cases when trying to trigger an action at a certain time of a day (e.g. reminders, repeating messages, scheduled commands, etc.). Tip You can easily create such timestamp mentions in a Discord-ready syntax using HammerTime by DJDavid98 . Warning Using timestamp mentions as time code will only work if the timestamp you are using refers to a future date.","title":"Modules Documentation 101"},{"location":"Contents/Modules%20Documentation%20101/#modules-documentation-101","text":"Throughout the whole documentation website, you'll find different ways of explaining commands and a few keywords to indicate particular ways of writing a parameter.","title":"Modules Documentation 101"},{"location":"Contents/Modules%20Documentation%20101/#serverguild-channel-message-role-user-ids","text":"Note: Each entity in Discord is mapped with a unique ID.

Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. Do We Use Cookies And Other Tracking Technologies? In Short: No. We don't use cookies, nor similar tracking technologies in our Website to access or store information. How Do We Handle Your Social Logins? In Short: If you choose to log in to our Services using your Discord account, we may have access to certain information about you. Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (specifically, your Discord account). We don't specifically have an account management solution, nor will you ever have an \"account with us\". When a login procedure is needed to access our Services, you will be using your Discord account. When you do so, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider (Discord). The profile information we receive may vary, but will often include your username, profile picture, as well as other information Discord may choose to make public. We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps. Is Your Information Transferred Internationally? In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own. Our infrastructure is located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information, and in other countries. How Long Do We Keep Your Information? In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). For data related to the Forms module, submissions are saved for 12 months before being deleted from our database. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe? In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. Hereafter, you'll find an exemplary and not exhaustive list of measures we implemented to keep your data safe: User Identification and Discord End User Data Processing: Wherever possible, the only identification key related to you that is stored on our system is your \"Discord ID\". Your \"Discord ID\" is a number provided by the Discord API and linked to your Discord End User Data. Your username, message content, data you provide to Discord, etc. is accessed by requesting such data through the Discord API using your Discord ID, while a minimal amount of data is stored in our Services. Encryption at Rest: Data stored by our Services is encrypted at rest (when saved in our database, or any data storage media we may be using) using best-in-class algorithms (e.g. AES-256-GCM) and following the most diffuse security guidelines. In some cases, data may be encrypted through multiple levels of encryption using different encryption keys; this approach is applied to all and any custom input we receive from the Discord API related to your Discord message content. Encryption in Transit: Data processed by our Services, or transferred between different components of our infrastructure, is encrypted using best-in-class algorithms (e.g. TLS 1.2+ with Mutual Authentication) and following the most diffuse security guidelines. Authentication, Authorization, Auditing: Our Services implement security measures that only allow authorized users to access any stored data. Infrastructure Security: Data is segregated into different components of the infrastructure that provides our Services. Technical and organizational security measures are in place to minimize the chance of an intruder having access to our infrastructure. What Are Your Privacy Rights? In Short: By choosing GDPR as our privacy framework, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. Multiple privacy frameworks may be applied when storing and processing your data. We chose to align with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), extending those rights to you independently of where you are. In \"GDPR terminology\", as referred in Article 4, we often refer to the following concept: Data Subject: any identifiable natural person whose personal data may be accessed, stored, and processed (in other words, you); Data Controller: determines the purposes for which and the means by which personal data is processed; Data Processor: processes personal data only on behalf of the controller; We are a Data Controller of the information you provide to us, and a Data Processor of the Discord End User Data we are provided by the Discord API. According to the GDPR, in certain circumstances (Chapter 3), you may have the following data protection rights: The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you. The right of rectification. The right to object. The right of restriction. The right to data portability. The right to withdraw consent. In circumstances where these rights may apply, you may request the application of such rights. To make such a request, you may email us at privacy@discomm.cc detailing your inquiry. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. Upon receiving your request, we may need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts may require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. In such cases, we will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you. How Can You Opt Out Of Providing Your Data? In Short: Our Services may offer the ability to self opt-out of providing your data. When this option is not available, you may contact us to have your situation examined. Under certain circumstances, you may decide to opt-out of providing your data to us or, in other words, request us to have your personal information deleted from our Services. Depending on the personal information we collect, store, and process, and the specific Service we are offering to you, you may be able to self opt-out of providing some, or all, data. In relation to the data that we collect, store, and process, you may have the following options regarding the ability to opt-out, or have your data deleted: Discord ID: Opting out of providing your Discord ID may not be possible in all circumstances. Your Discord ID is, in a general way, not a specific personal information unless it's matched with other personal information that is collected, stored, and processed by Discord. You may refer to the Discord privacy policies and terms of service to know how to opt-out of providing your Discord ID. Partial Discord Message Content: In regard to the content of messages that let you directly interact with our Bot, such as when using commands, you may self opt-out of all occasions where you provided us with any custom input by disabling, or properly reconfiguring, such features that were configured using custom inputs. Full Discord Message Content: In regard to the content of messages that you send using the Discord App, even when the message is not related to a direct interaction with our Bot, you may (or may not) have the ability to self opt-out of providing your data depending on the technical implementation of such features that access your full message content. You may refer to the technical documentation of our Services for more information about whether this ability is provided. Other Identifiers: When directly interacting with us, you may request your personal information to be deleted at any time during our interaction. In case where such request is made, we may not be able to provide you with the information, or Service, you are requesting from us. Other Discord End User Data: In regard to other types of content we may obtain through the Discord API, you may refer to the Discord privacy policies and terms of service to know how to opt-out of providing such data. In all cases where self opt-out is not an option, you may email us at privacy@discomm.cc detailing your inquiry. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Do We Make Updates To This Policy? In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated \"Last Revised\" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a policy of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. To What Extent Does This Policy Apply? (a.k.a. Third-Party Privacy Policies) In Short: While we do our best to keep our providers under observation, you are advised to refer to their respective privacy policies for further details. Our Services are based on both self-developed and self-managed assets, and assets that are provided to us by external third-party providers. In choosing our providers, we assess their technical and organizational policies and choose those that preserve your privacy according to valid policies.

Since December 2019, GiselleBot has handled over 870,000 successful commands, with an average of ~1,200 commands per day. Infrastructure The bot is hosted on GalaxyGate. The infrastructure is currently composed of 5 main components: 1 Web Server, hosting the documentation website and the API gateway used to communicate with the bots(s) from the external world. 1 Application Server, hosting the bot itself. 1 Application Server, hosting the supporting microservices. 3 MongoDB machines, forming a high-availability Replica Set. 3 Redis instances, forming a high-availability set managed through Redis Sentinel. Redis is used a high performance in-memory cache for the most used DB queries. The instances are hosted on the same servers that host MongoDB, but the Primary instance of each datastore is on different servers at any time. Other than the plain computing power, from GalaxyGate, some PaaS services are provided by Amazon Web Services: Object Storage buckets, hosting the temporary (encrypted) files that are sent to end-users via a variety of commands. A centralized log management system. A Key Management System / Secrets Manager, storing the secret keys and API keys used by the bot. Private keys and/or credentials are never stored on the actual servers, they are fetched during the startup of each service. A DNS managed service, hosting the public cycloptux.com and gisellebot.com domains, the short gisl.eu domain and the internal private domain. Security Regarding the security aspects of the bot, here's a list of features that have been implemented: Encryption in Transit Internal network communications between all infrastructure components only happen on a private network (VLAN) specifically instanced by the hosting provider, and never go through the internet.pplication server, web server, microservices and DB machines are encrypted using SSL/TLS (specifically, TLS 1.1+) encryption, with 2-way forced validation of server and client certificates. Network connections between the API gateway and the application server and microservices are encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) encryption, with forced 2-way validation of server and client certificates. The certificates used to encrypt data in transit are released by an internal Certificate Authority (which is on a different hosting provider, and powered off when not in use, to protect its keys). The certificates are signed by an intermediate CA which then points at the root CA, so that the root CA key is never used and the intermediate CA can be killed if compromised. The web server and API gateway are only exposed to the internet through HTTPS (HSTS). The web access itself is protected through Cloudflare . The network connection between Cloudflare and the actual web server is also protected by strict HTTPS using automatically renewed certificates signed by Let\\'s Encrypt . Encryption at Rest All storage media (hard disks, object storage repositories, etc.) are protected through low-level encryption. Potentially sensitive and personal data (basically, anything that can be assimilated to a string) stored in the database is encrypted using military-grade AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM algorithms. Commands that generate big files (such as a chat log) may transmit the file to the user via Direct Message by temporarily storing it into an encrypted Object Storage bucket. The archive itself is also encrypted using 7-Zip\\'s encryption algorithm, based on AES-256. The password is purposefully never logged into the bot internal logs and is only known to the end user. As an extra layer of security, users can decide to delete the bot\\'s message so that the password is also removed from Discord itself. Refer to deletedm for more info. The retention for these files is currently set to 30 days. Authentication, Authorization, Auditing SSH access to the infrastructure is only available from within the internal network. The internal network can be accessed through a hardened bastion VPN endpoint. SSH access to the virtual servers is protected via private keys and, in some cases, multifactor authentication. Sensitive information needed by the microservices are either fetched from the KMS when the microservice starts, or passed through temporary environmental variables. Every access and action is logged, both in the API gateway and in the application server. All bot commands are logged. The API offered by the bots are not directly accessed from the internet. The API gateway acts as a bridge, and implements a fully fledged authentication and authorization workflow used to create and distribute temporary tokens to the end users. Further authorization checks are applied on the specific API calls to restrict \"authorized\" users from requesting data that doesn't belong to them. Infrastructure Security Each host is protected by a local firewall, making sure that only the required ports are open. The SSH service is not exposed to the internet. Infrastructure management portals are protected by strong passwords and multifactor authentication. Encryption keys, secret access keys, secret tokens, credentials, etc. are never stored into local drives. An external Key Management System (KMS) is used to fetch secret keys at runtime. The database is backed up every 12 hours, and the retention policy for backup files is set to keep backups on a highly available Object Storage repository for at least 30 days. The source code for the bot, and all of its related dependencies, is stored in private Git-based repositories.","title":"Technical & Security Background"},{"location":"Contents/Technical%20%26%20Security%20Background/#technical-security-background","text":"Last Revised: November 15, 2021","title":"Technical &amp; Security Background"},{"location":"Contents/Technical%20%26%20Security%20Background/#core-engine","text":"The bot is written in Node.js, and uses Discord.js v13 as core Discord library.

The module gets its default questions from the Open Trivia Database , which offers more than 3,000 validated questions in more than 15 categories. The trivia module is meant to be public and used by anyone for fun. Users with \\\"Manage Messages\\\" & \\\"Manage Roles\\\" permissions, hereafter called \\\"Elevated Users\\\", will also have access to extra settings that will make them able to set trivia quiz games up for use by other users (typical use cases include events, giveaways, etc.). Trivia games can be timed or immediate . Immediate trivia games move to the next question as soon as one answer is collected. Timed trivia games move to the next question as soon as a certain time interval passes, and collect answers from anyone during that period (limitations may apply, see later).

The game was released in 4 regions/versions: CN (Chinese) JP (Japanese) KR (Korean) EN (English/Global) Commands azurstatus Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} azurstatus [--region {region code}] ::: Command Description Checks the status of Azur Lane\\'s game servers. Omitting the region code will assume --region en and show the status of the (4, at the time of writing this page) English servers. The Chinese region will print 2 embeds: one for the Android servers, one for the iOS servers. Other regions have common servers among the 2 platforms. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} azurstatus azurstatus --region cn ::: Server Status Live Feed The Azur Lane Server Status Feed offers an easy way to monitor Azur Lane servers availability for any region , and be notified when something changes on one (or more) of the webhooks configured in your Discord server. ::: {.seealso} In order to better understand this module, it\\'s very important that you are familiar with Discord webhooks. For more details about this Discord feature, please take a look at this official guide . ::: By default, the status feed mascot will be the Azur Lane character (ship) San Diego , and all of the feed messages will be Azur Lane-themed. The full list of feed messages and monitored transitions can be found in this Google Spreadsheet . Each message will be followed by a list of hashtags, that users may use to filter the specific messages they are interested into, indicating: The region code whom the message refers to: #cn #en #jp #kr The current status of the region, using a technical status tag: #gateway_error #full_offline #partial_offline #operational One or more server name tags, indicating the specific impacted servers: e.g. #avrora #lexington ... The quote ID (refer to the Azur Lane Server Status Feed Sentences Google Spreadsheet ) for the region status transition and/or server status transition: e.g. #r_01 #r_02 s_02 ... {.align-center width=\"600px\"} azurhook Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} azurhook (webhook URL or --channel (channel id/mention/q_name)) [customization params] ::: Command Description Starts a live feed on the specified webhook. When a new transition is found, its notification will be sent to the specified webhook service. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack 2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message containing any kind of content using external tools and send that message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare) occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the --channel (channel id/mention/q_name) parameter: a new dedicated webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be automatically used for this feed. This alternative option requires to have \\\"Manage Webhooks\\\" permissions. ::: Customization Params --region (first region code) [second region code] [...] Adds a whitelist , inclusive filter for Azur Lane server regions to the stream. Transitions that are referring to (one of) the selected region(s) will be sent to the webhook, while the rest will be skipped. This parameter only supports these region codes: cn en jp kr Region codes are case-insensitive. Default : No filter (all regions) --filter (first word) [second word] [...] Adds a whitelist filter to the feed. In this example, if the status quote contains first word and/or (see below) second word , the submission will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You can set one or more words, case-insensitive. This is especially effective if you are using the provided hashtags to filter specific events of interest. You can also set \\\"composite words\\\" (two or more words as a single filter) by quoting them: \"foo bar\" test will count as 2 filter elements: foo bar and test . The filter works on partial words (e.g. \\\"announce\\\" will work on both \\\"announcement\\\" and \\\"announced\\\").

It will let you configure all of the following options: Bot prefix Activity Logging Greeter Automatic role assignment/removal Self assignable roles This guide will serve as a brief introduction for how, why, and when you should use these commands. It is not meant as a replacement to the documentation for each command. For more details, please consult the administration full documentation page. Warning This guide assumes you have all the necessary permissions to run each command. The easiest way (but not necessarily suggested, in an absolute way) to make sure all commands work is to have the Administrator permission on one of your roles, and to make sure the bot has Administrator on one of its roles. For specifics on the permissions needed for each command, see administration {.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}. Bot Prefix The bot prefix is the symbol you type before the bot command name in order to have the bot recognize that you\\'re talking to it. By default, the bot\\'s prefix is (). However, you can use the prefix command to set a new prefix. For example, if you are already using a bot with as the command prefix, you could run the following command to change the bot\\'s prefix to a question mark. ::: {.parsed-literal} prefix ? ::: After you set the bot prefix (if you need to) you can start setting up the rest of the modules. Unless otherwise specified, this introduction will assume you have a dedicated, private channel, such as #bot-console, for running bot commands. You don\\'t need to have such a channel setup, but it\\'s often useful to separate bot commands from other messages and it keep them private. Server Activity Logging Logging server activity is important to supplement Discord\\'s server Audit Log and to capture activity that it does not, such as deleted messages and attachments. Discord\\'s Audit Log also clears out old activity, while messages in a channel will remain forever. The logging module also includes the ability (only for patrons of the bot developer) to selectively ignore specific users and channels meaning that you are still able to control the information that is logged on your server. This is important if your logs are visible to a group of people that not all channels are visible to. Logging Example Here is one way to set up the logging for your server. Create the following channels a. #log-members b. #log-users (If you are a patron of the bot developer) c. #log-messages d. #log-mod e. #log-warn f. #log-roles g. #log-channels h. #log-voice (If you are a patron of the bot developer) i. #log-server (If you are a patron of the bot developer) Run the following commands in each channel a. log members b. log users (if you are a patron) c. log messages d. log moderation e. log warning f. log roles g. log channels h. log voice (if you are a patron) i. log server (if you are a patron) If your Discord name is \\@NaviKing#3820, you are a patron and you have an #admin-channel that isn\\'t visible to Moderators, you could have the bot ignore you and all the messages in that channel using the following commands a. logignore channels #admin-channel b. logignore members \\@NaviKing#3820 ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: While the moderation module will log some external moderation actions, it is primarily intended to be used with the warning log in conjunction with the bot\\'s moderation module. This module will be discussed in another guide. ::: Greeter When new members join your Discord server, it is often nice to welcome them to the server and give them some guidance on what to do next. The bot includes two types of greeters: one that sends a direct message to a user when they join the server, and another that sends a message in a specific channel. Some administrators prefer to have slightly different messages in each, while others prefer to use only one. You can also configure the greeter to delete itself after a certain amount of time. Greeter Example You could set up a greeter as follows Create a #greeter channel Run greet in the #greeter channel Run greetmsg Welcome to the server, %user%! Run greetdel 60 If NaviKing#3820 joins your server, the bot will send the message \\\"Welcome to the server, \\@NaviKing#3820!\\\" in the #greeter channel, and then delete it after 60 seconds. Similarly, if you used greetdm and greetdmmsg instead of greet and greetmsg, it would send a message to that user as a direct message (the direct message would not be autodeleted though). If you use greetdm, it doesn\\'t matter what channel you run the command in. Remember that some users have direct messages disabled by default though, so it might not always work. Remember, if you enable one or both greeters with greetdm or greet but don\\'t set a message, nothing will happen when users join the server! Automated Role Assignment/Removal Oftentimes, it\\'s useful to grant a role to a user as soon as they join the server. Sometimes this is used to bar new users from viewing certain channels, to give all users a different color from the default Discord color, or just to recognize the users as new! This is a common feature in Discord bots, but this bot also features the ability to automatically remove one or more roles after a certain amount of time. The bot also allows you to specify a role that users receive when they join a voice channel. This is often used to allow users access to a corresponding text channel. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: All roles used in commands should exist prior to running the command. The bot will not create roles that don\\'t already exist. ::: Role Assignment/Removal Example If you want to give a Newcomer role to members that join the server, you can run the following command aar Newcomer You could then have the bot remove this role after 3 days arr 3d Newcomer Join the General voice channel and run the following command vcrole \\\"General Voice\\\" This will give the General Voice role to users that join the General voice channel. Note the quotation marks around the role name. These are necessary if the role name is two or more words. You can undo these commands in the following fashion aar Newcomer will stop the role from being autoassigned if it is currently being autoassigned arr Newcomer exclude the time code, the bot will stop removing the role Join the voice channel that has an associated role and just type vcrole Provide no role names, the bot will stop assigning a role ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: The time code format uses mo/w/d/h/m for months/weeks/days/hours/minutes. Any command that uses a timecode in any module follows this format. For example, if you use 1d3h2m as the time code, that lets the bot know that it should be 1 day, 3 hours, and 2 minutes. More info in timecode . ::: Self Assignable Roles One of the most complex modules of the bot, this allows you to configure roles that users can assign to themselves via the bot. It is strongly recommended to read the full documentation on self assignable roles. This section will cover only the basics. Self assignable roles are used for many reasons. Users may want to opt in or opt out of specific channels. By allowing specific roles access (or excluding them) via channel permissions, users have control over which channels they can or can\\'t see. Users may want to change their Discord name color. By creating roles with a variety of colors, users can self assign a color of their choice Users may want to volunteer for certain duties. For example, creating a taggable \\@Helper role and making it self assignable allows people to volunteer to be tagged if they need help. Users may want to opt in for notifications. For example, instead of using \\@everyone for server updates, you can create a taggable \\@Server Updates role. Users can then opt in to this role and be tagged if there are updates about the Discord server Setting up Self Assignable Roles - Basics In this bot, you can assign any number of roles to a group of self assignable roles like so ::: {.parsed-literal} asar 1 Role1 \\\"Role 2\\\" \\\"Role 3\\\" Role4 ::: Will add the following roles to group 1 Role1 Role 2 Role 3 Role4 You can remove roles from a group with rsar in the same fashion (e.g., rsar 1 Role1 will remove Role1 from group 1). You can list all the self assignable roles on the server with lsar. It will display them by group. You can use the sargs command and a role ID to configure advanced options for self assignable roles. For example ::: {.parsed-literal} sargs 1 ::: will let you configure additional options for group 1. These are explained in the resulting command menu and also on the dedicated documentation page (see self-assignable-roles {.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}), and will not be covered here. Using Self Assignable Roles Users can then assign themselves these roles using a role menu (explained later) or via iam and remove these roles via iamnot. For example ::: {.parsed-literal} iam Role1 ::: will add Role1 to the user that runs the command and ::: {.parsed-literal} iamnot Role1 ::: will remove the role Role Menus Some users find it difficult to use iam and iamnot because it requires the command and role name to be typed exactly correct. Many users find it simpler to use role menus, which allow users to assign and remove roles from a single group by reacting to a message. Continuing the previous example, you can use the following command to create a role menu for group 1 ::: {.parsed-literal} rmcreate 1 ::: The bot will create a message to use as the role menu and prompt you to provide a reaction for each role. The bot will build the role menu as you react and let users know which reactions correspond to which roles. You can also create your own role menu by using --m and providing a valid message ID. To get a message ID, make sure developer mode is enabled (User Settings -> Appearance -> Developer Mode) and then right click on a message and choose Copy ID. For example ::: {.parsed-literal} rmcreate 1 --m 591116046606270464 ::: will create a role menu using the message with the ID 591116046606270464 in the current channel. You may also find that you want to add additional roles to a role group. In that case, you can run the following command to have the bot add reactions for the new roles in the most recent role group in the channel, or use --m and a valid message ID to update the role menu on that channel ::: {.parsed-literal} rmupdate ::: Similarly, if you want to remove a role menu, you can use the following command to remove the most recent role menu in the channel, or use --m and a valid message ID to remove the role menu from that message. It will not delete the reactions, just prevent them from being used as a role menu. ::: {.parsed-literal} rmremove ::: It is often useful to have a separate channel for self assignable roles and have multiple role menus in that channel, so using the --m parameter to specify a particular message is extremely useful. Be sure that when you are configuring the role menus that you are using emoji from Discord or from your own server, as the bot cannot use emotes it does not have access to. Summary The administrative module greatly enhances the functionality of your server. From the basics of setting a custom command prefix, you can enable logging of various items on your server, greet people as they join, automatically give and remove roles from them, and even allow people to pick their own roles! These functions are the foundation of a flexible server structure and allow for greater customization, tracking, and organization.","title":"1 Administration"},{"location":"Guides/1-Administration/#step-1-configuring-the-administration-module","text":"Author : NaviKing#3820 The Administration module is the first module you should use when managing a Discord server.

Self-Assignable Roles IMPORTANT NOTE : The bot will be able to assign a role only if it has both \\\"Manage Roles\\\" permissions AND if the role it\\'s trying to assign is lower than the highest role the bot has. Please arrange your roles accordingly. Before we delve into the actual self-assignable roles, it\\'s very important that you become familiar with role groups . A role group is a group of Discord roles that will share the same set of assignment rules. Each role group can be configured by editing the following settings: Name : Custom name for the group. Mode : Given a group of Discord roles, the assignment mode defines how roles will be assigned to users: Single Mode : Users can only have 1 role within this group. Multiple Mode : Users can have a minimum and a maximum number of roles within this group. None : No specific rules are applied. Required and ignored roles (see below) still apply. Required Roles : This setting requires users to have at least one of the specified roles to be able to self-assign one role within this group. Ignored Roles : This setting requires users not to have any of the specified roles to be able to self-assign one role within this group. Or, in other words, users with at least one of the specified roles won\\'t have access to this group. Prerequisites Check : Toggles the periodic monitoring of role requirements for self-assigned roles. The configuration of self-assignable roles allows for preventing users with certain roles from receiving roles from a certain group, or to only receive roles from a group if they already have (one or more) different, particular role(s). By default, the monitoring feature is disabled and prerequisite checks only happen upon the assignment (or removal) of the role. Upon activating the periodic monitoring feature, self-assignable roles within the selected group are re-checked automatically so that if a user fails the prerequisite checks (e.g. by either having an ignored role, or losing a required role, or having multiple roles from a group in \\\"Single\\\" mode), they will lose the previously acquired role. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Prerequisites checks only happen every 15-30 minutes. ::: In Single or Multiple mode, you\\'ll also have access to additional, optional settings: Single Mode Settings Require 1 role in group at all times (after initial assignment) : Whether the role is assigned by a 3rd party or self-assigned, users won\\'t be able to self-remove all of the roles in the group. Remove existing role when assigning another role in group : Self-assigning a role within this group will remove any other group role from the user. Multiple Mode Settings Minimum number of roles : Users won\\'t be able to self-remove a role if the removal would bring them under this threshold of group roles. Maximum number of roles : Users won\\'t be able to self-assign a role if the assignment would bring them over this threshold of group roles. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: One role can be assigned to more than one group . While technically possible, this is generally not recommended unless you know what you are doing. In such cases, you must design your settings to avoid conflicts between the different group settings. Conflicting settings will cause unpredictable behaviors . ::: Once a role group is configured, two ways of self-assigning a group will be available to users: Role Menus : Interactive menus using Discord emoji reactions to assign and remove roles. Role menus can be created from scratch using bot commands (see below) or \\\"attached\\\" to an existing user message. Manual Commands : The iam and iamnot commands will always be available to anyone. Specific permissions will need to be handled by using the \\\"Required Roles\\\" and \\\"Ignored Roles\\\" settings. Here\\'s the full list of available commands for this sub-module: sargs Command Description Opens the self-assignable roles (i.e. role groups) interactive setup menu. Use the menu items to configure the above settings. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Mode-specific settings will only work if the corresponding mode is currently set as active. ::: asar Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} asar [group id] (role id(s)/mention(s)/q_name(s)) ::: Command Description Adds one or more roles to the specified group.

Emoji Submissions Through the \\\"Emoji Submissions\\\" sub-module, you can let your members submit new emojis to be used your server. You can configure one or more roles that will be allowed to submit new emojis. If a user tries to submit an emoji while having more than one role up, only the highest role will be considered in order to avoid unpredictable conflicts. For each role, you will be able to configure: Whether the role will be allowed to submit emojis without further verification. By setting a verification channel, authorized users (more on that below) will be able to accept or reject an emoji submission before it\\'s actually uploaded. By disabling the verification channel, the emoji will be immediately uploaded without further verification. By default , the additional verification step is disabled . Which roles will be able to accept or reject an emoji submission, provided you enabled the verification channel. These roles will also be mentioned (optional, see below) within the verification channel when a submission is received. Users that are enabled to use the administration module using the permissions will always be authorized to accept or reject any emoji submission. By default , no additional roles are enabled to accept or reject emoji submissions. How many emojis (submitted through this system) the role will be allowed to have up at any given time. If the verification step is active, users are virtually allowed to submit any number of emojis. By setting a maximum number of emojis through the dedicated setting, you are locking the maximum number of accepted emojis. By default , there is no limit to how many active emojis a user can have. Whether the periodic monitoring of prerequisites is active for this role. If this option is active, the emojis will be deleted if the user leaves the server and/or if the user loses the role that they \\\"used\\\" to submit the emoji. For example, you can have Nitro Boosters submit one or more emojis, and then have their emoji removed if they stop boosting the server (hence losing the Nitro Boost role). Even if this option is disabled, emojis that are manually deleted will also be removed from this system. By default , this option is disabled. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Prerequisites checks only happen every 15-30 minutes. ::: Whether the authorized role(s) will be mentioned when a new emoji submission is received.

A proper configuration of the emoji submitter roles will avoid an improper use of this command. Users won\\'t need \\\"Manage Emojis and Stickers\\\" permissions to run this command, but will still check for its own \\\"Manage Emojis and Stickers\\\" permissions to be sure it can upload the emoji upon a successful verification, if any. By default, no role is set as emoji submitter role (before a proper configuration) and this command will not have any effect. ::: The emoji image can be provided by using an existing emoji (this will only work if the bot has access to the emoji from another server) , or a valid image URL, or an image provided in forms of an attachment to the submit message. Emoji images must be under 256 KB in size and one of these formats: .jpg , .jpeg , .png , .gif . Emoji names must be at least 2 characters long (and no more than 32 characters long) and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. You must not include the colon (:) characters in the emoji name. Users are also not allowed to submit an emoji that has the same name of an existing server emoji. will attempt to limit the amount of duplicate emoji submissions by checking, wherever possible, the ID of the submitted emoji with the IDs of already active server emojis. In order to avoid unpredictable conflicts, if a user tries to submit an emoji while having more than one \\\"emoji submitter\\\" role up, only the highest role will be considered for the optional limits/configurations.

Please arrange your roles accordingly. Before we delve into the actual self-assignable roles, it\\'s very important that you become familiar with role groups . A role group is a group of Discord roles that will share the same set of assignment rules. Each role group can be configured by editing the following settings: Name : Custom name for the group. Mode : Given a group of Discord roles, the assignment mode defines how roles will be assigned to users: Single Mode : Users can only have 1 role within this group. Multiple Mode : Users can have a minimum and a maximum number of roles within this group. None : No specific rules are applied. Required and ignored roles (see below) still apply. Required Roles : This setting requires users to have at least one of the specified roles to be able to self-assign one role within this group. Ignored Roles : This setting requires users not to have any of the specified roles to be able to self-assign one role within this group. Or, in other words, users with at least one of the specified roles won\\'t have access to this group. Prerequisites Check : Toggles the periodic monitoring of role requirements for self-assigned roles. The configuration of self-assignable roles allows for preventing users with certain roles from receiving roles from a certain group, or to only receive roles from a group if they already have (one or more) different, particular role(s). By default, the monitoring feature is disabled and prerequisite checks only happen upon the assignment (or removal) of the role. Upon activating the periodic monitoring feature, self-assignable roles within the selected group are re-checked automatically so that if a user fails the prerequisite checks (e.g. by either having an ignored role, or losing a required role, or having multiple roles from a group in \\\"Single\\\" mode), they will lose the previously acquired role. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Prerequisites checks only happen every 15-30 minutes. ::: In Single or Multiple mode, you\\'ll also have access to additional, optional settings: Single Mode Settings Require 1 role in group at all times (after initial assignment) : Whether the role is assigned by a 3rd party or self-assigned, users won\\'t be able to self-remove all of the roles in the group. Remove existing role when assigning another role in group : Self-assigning a role within this group will remove any other group role from the user. Multiple Mode Settings Minimum number of roles : Users won\\'t be able to self-remove a role if the removal would bring them under this threshold of group roles. Maximum number of roles : Users won\\'t be able to self-assign a role if the assignment would bring them over this threshold of group roles. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: One role can be assigned to more than one group . While technically possible, this is generally not recommended unless you know what you are doing. In such cases, you must design your settings to avoid conflicts between the different group settings. Conflicting settings will cause unpredictable behaviors . ::: Once a role group is configured, two ways of self-assigning a group will be available to users: Role Menus : Interactive menus using Discord emoji reactions to assign and remove roles. Role menus can be created from scratch using bot commands (see below) or \\\"attached\\\" to an existing user message. Manual Commands : The iam and iamnot commands will always be available to anyone. Specific permissions will need to be handled by using the \\\"Required Roles\\\" and \\\"Ignored Roles\\\" settings.

Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server | Bot : Manage Roles Moderation Commands These moderation commands are the actual commands that are used to apply moderation actions. Each one of the following commands will be very similar in nature, and thus the common features of the commands will be discussed together in this section, and the specifics of each command in subsections. Collectively, these commands will be referred to as \\\"warning commands\\\". The list of \\\"warning commands\\\" is the following: warn kick ban delayban mute imageban cban cmute cimageban By default, warning commands will generate a new case if the Warning log is active. Upon generating a case, a DM will be sent to the target user(s), notifying them of the moderation action that has been triggered on them, who issued the moderation action and the specifics of the rules that are broken, if applicable. Please refer to the \\\"Warning Point System\\\" section below for more details about the rules system. These commands support being used on multiple users at once: if more than one user is targeted by these commands, the parameters will be parallelized for all of the users, while multiple cases will be generated. The following commands also support being set as \\\"automatically expiring after X time\\\": mute delayban imageban cban cmute cimageban This is achieved by prepending the target users with a time code. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: This time setting will overwrite the previous setting each time the command is run on a specified user: this also applies to converting a permanent action into a timed one and vice-versa, without removing the role on the target user. ::: (Common) Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} {warning command} [duration timecode] [channel id/mention/q_name {only for channel-specific commands}] (user id(s)/mention(s)/q_name(s)) [--rule {rule id/name/alias}] [--reason {textual description}] [--attachments {urls}] [--padj {signed/unsigned number}] [--justification {textual justification}] [--skip-case] [--skip-dm] ::: (Common) Command Description Informs the user(s) via DM that they have been warned/muted/banned/etc., including the rule that they broke, the specific reason, attachments, and who warned them. These arguments are all optional when running warning commands (only the user identifier is required). If applicable, the --reason parameter will appear in the Discord native audit log as well. If all of these arguments are skipped, the message will simply read \\\"You were warned/muted/banned by [moderator].\\\". Channel specific commands which are missing the channel parameter will default to being targeted to the current channel. Channels that support time-based expiration (see above) will be treated as permanent if the timecode is missing. You can skip generating a case by appending the --skip-case tag. You can skip sending the DM (but still generate a case) by appending the --skip-dm tag. --skip-case also implies --skip-dm . ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: When --skip-dm is used, a small \ud83d\udd15 emoji will appear on the corresponding notification and warning log embed footer to track the fact that the action was \\\"silent\\\". ::: Every warning, by default, will be worth a certain number of points based on the rule broken (as described in the \\\"Warning Point System\\\" section below. The --padj , or \\\"points added/subtracted\\\" argument, is completely optional and will not be included in the DM even if it is included in the command. Any signed number (\\\"+\\\" or \\\"-\\\") will be treated as a \\\"delta\\\" value over the default rule score, while an unsigned number will be treated as a fixed, absolute value and used as the actual warning score. The justification for points added/subtracted is invalid if no points were added or subtracted and should be ignored if the moderator does not add or subtract any points. Each one of the command parameters has one or more aliases. Here are the available aliases: --rule : --r --reason : --rs --attachments : --attachment --att --a --padj : --pa --p --justification : --just --j --skip-case : --skipcase --nocase --no-case --skip-dm : --skipdm --nodm --no-dm Running the command as the \\\"description\\\" of a Discord attachment (e.g. by drag-and-dropping an image over the Discord client) will automatically add that object as the warning case attachment, even if the --attachments parameter is skipped. As said above, these commands will automatically generate a server-specific case ID that can be used as reference in other commands. An embed including the following information will also be generated and put into the warning log: Warning Type (warn/mute/ban/etc.) Warned user\\'s name Warned user\\'s ID Mod Name Rule broken Reason Attachment (as embed\\'s image, if applicable) Points added/subtracted (optional) Justification (only if points are added/subtracted) Total unexpired points as of warning for this user Suggested moderation action & number of points to next warning threshold Case ID & timestamp (in footer) If any of the rule, reason or attachments parameters are missing, the bot will tag the moderator upon action log generation prompting them to fill in the missing arguments using the edit command. The bot will also tag the moderator the first time that the user reaches a suggested action threshold. Some moderation action commands have a \\\"un-\\\" version that reverts the corresponding moderation action. \\\"un-\\\" commands will follow a similar syntax but will never generate a new case, hence rendering the set of warning parameters (every parameter after the user identifier(s)) useless. What follows is a list of all of the commands in this section. As already said, each command description and syntax will be a diff over the common syntax shown here. warn Command Description warn does nothing but DM the user(s) with their warning. Its purpose is to officially record an infraction so that the accumulation of infractions can later be used to justify a mute or a ban (see the \\\"Warning Point System\\\" described later). Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} warn \\@cycloptux#1543 --rule Discord ToS --reason The user is under 13 years of age --padj -2 --justification Testing the command ::: kick Command Description Kicks the target user(s) from the current server. The user may be able to join the server again through a working invite. Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Kick Members | Bot : Kick Members mute Command Description mute applies the role configured in muterole (or creates a default \\\"Muted Users\\\" role at the bottom of the role list with no permissions if the mute role is not configured) to the target user(s) and sets all channel permissions (except for the ones configured as mute chat(s)) for the mute role, as described in the previous sections. The specific permissions for this command will be set (or checked/updated) every time the command is run, hence making the command slightly slower than usual. This is normal. The mute can be permanent (users will be muted until manual removal) or timed (users will be unmuted automatically after a certain time span). Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles, Mute Members | Bot : Manage Roles, Mute Members ban Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} ban [24/7] ... ::: Command Description ban has one additional, optional argument before the user identifier(s): either the number 24, or the number 7. If this argument is omitted, the user is banned without their message history being deleted. Otherwise, the bot uses the native ban API to delete the last 24 hours or 7 days of the banned users\\' message history. The same parameter can also be passed by using the --days argument (e.g. --days 1 or --days 7 ). --days also has the following aliases: --msgdays --delmsg --purge --d This command also works for banning users that are currently not in the server, as long as the user is known/cached by the bot. It is advised to use the user ID for that. Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Ban Members | Bot : Ban Members timeban Command Description timeban bans a user from the current server for the specified amount of time. Once the ban period has ended, as long as the user hasn\\'t been permanently banned by \\\"overwriting\\\" the timed ban with a fully fledged ban (or manually re-allowed through unban), the ban will be automatically lifted. If the time argument is omitted, it will default to 24 hours. Please allow for up to 1 extra minute before the ban is actually lifted after it has officially expired. This command also works for banning users that are currently not in the server, as long as the user is known/cached by the bot. It is advised to use the user ID for that. Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Ban Members | Bot : Ban Members delayban Command Description delayban mutes a user for the specified amount of time. If this mute status isn\\'t removed with cancelban before the timer is out, the user will be banned from the server. If the time argument is omitted, it will default to 24 hours. Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles, Mute Members, Ban Members | Bot : Manage Roles, Mute Members, Ban Members imageban Command Description imageban applies the role configured in imagebanrole (or creates a default \\\"Image Banned Users\\\" role at the bottom of the role list with no permissions if the image ban role is not configured) to the target user(s) and sets all channel permissions for the image ban role, as described in the previous sections. The specific permissions for this command will be set (or checked/updated) every time the command is run, hence making the command slightly slower than usual. This is normal. The image ban can be permanent (users will be image banned until manual removal) or timed (users will be image unbanned automatically after a certain time span). Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles | Bot : Manage Roles cban Command Description cban applies the role configured in channelbanrole (or creates a default \\\"#%channel% Banned Users\\\" role at the bottom of the role list with no permissions if the channel ban role is not configured) to the target user(s) and sets the channel permissions for the ban role, as described in the previous sections. The specific permissions for this command will be set (or checked/updated) every time the command is run, hence making the command slightly slower than usual. This is normal. The channel ban can be permanent (users will be channel banned until manual removal) or timed (users will be channel unbanned automatically after a certain time span). Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles | Bot : Manage Roles cmute Command Description cmute applies the role configured in channelmuterole (or creates a default \\\"#%channel% Muted Users\\\" role at the bottom of the role list with no permissions if the channel mute role is not configured) to the target user(s) and sets the channel permissions for the mute role, as described in the previous sections. The specific permissions for this command will be set (or checked/updated) every time the command is run, hence making the command slightly slower than usual. This is normal. The channel mute can be permanent (users will be channel muted until manual removal) or timed (users will be channel unmuted automatically after a certain time span). Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles, Mute Members | Bot : Manage Roles, Mute Members cimageban Command Description cimageban applies the role configured in channelimagebanrole (or creates a default \\\"#%channel% Image Banned Users\\\" role at the bottom of the role list with no permissions if the channel image ban role is not configured) to the target user(s) and sets the channel permissions for the image ban role, as described in the previous sections. The specific permissions for this command will be set (or checked/updated) every time the command is run, hence making the command slightly slower than usual. This is normal. The channel image ban can be permanent (users will be channel image banned until manual removal) or timed (users will be channel image unbanned automatically after a certain time span). Refer to moderation for the exact command syntax.

Omission of the channel identifier will result in the current channel being considered by the command. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles, Mute Members | Bot : Manage Roles, Mute Members cunban Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} cunban [channel id/mention/q_name] (user id(s)/mention(s)/q_name(s)) ::: Command Description Lifts the channel ban role from the target user(s). Omission of the channel identifier will result in the current channel being considered by the command. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles | Bot : Manage Roles cimageunban Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} cimageunban [channel id/mention/q_name] (user id(s)/mention(s)/q_name(s)) ::: Command Description Lifts the channel image ban role from the target user(s). Omission of the channel identifier will result in the current channel being considered by the command. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Roles | Bot : Manage Roles Utility Commands These moderation commands may be used in conjunction with the rest of the moderation module to keep your server clean. prune Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} prune (number of messages) [filter item] [--ignore {filter ignore}] ::: Command Description Deletes a certain number of messages from the channel in which the command is run. For security reasons, the bot caps this number to 250 messages. The filter items serve to delete/ignore a subset of messages in the set of messages specified by the integer argument. The list of available filters is: images : deletes all images in the set of messages bots : deletes all messages from bots in the set of messages links : deletes all messages with links in the set of messages emojis : deletes all messages with emojis in the set of messages reactions : deletes all of the reactions off of the messages in the set of messages, not the messages themselves embeds : deletes all embeds in the set of messages (this doesn\\'t include embeds that are generated by links, see links for that) text : deletes messages that only contain plain text in the set of messages invites : deletes messages containing Discord invites in the set of messages mentions : deletes messages containing a mention to a user, role, \\\"\\@everyone\\\" or \\\"\\@here\\\" in the set of messages {user mention} : deletes messages sent by the specified user in the set of messages {any text string} : deletes messages containing matching text from the supplied text string in the set of messages (for example, prune 100 \\\"donald trump\\\" would delete all messages containing \\\"donald trump\\\" in the last 100 messages) You can add an --ignore tag, combined with the aforementioned filter items, to ignore (and not delete) messages meeting that criteria. For example \\\"purge 100 bots --ignore embeds\\\" would delete all bot messages that weren\\'t embeds. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Messages | Bot : Manage Messages Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} prune 100 purge 250 bots clear 150 \\@cycloptux#1543 --ignore images ::: slowmode Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} slowmode [time code] [channel id(s)/mention(s)/q_name(s)] [--admode] ::: Command Description Sets slow mode for the current, or the selected, channels. This command leverages 2 different systems: If the slow mode time code is within Discord\\'s native slow mode time limit (less than 6 hours), the native slow mode is applied. If the slow mode time code exceeds Discord\\'s native time limit (more than 6 hours, up to 1 year), the bot will apply an \\\"extended slow mode\\\" status. The extended slow mode applies a minimal native slow mode to make sure the \\\"Slowmode is enabled\\\" message is shown. At the same time, each message sent by an unauthorized user will be automatically deleted, and the user will be notified of the applied slow mode. The extended slow mode doesn\\'t have a higher cap. Using the command without any argument will show the current settings for the server. Using the command with 0 in place of the time code will disable the slow mode for the current, or the selected, channel(s). The usage of the optional --admode parameter will enable the Auto-Delete mode, a.k.a. Bump Mode . If the extended slow mode is active (this mode will not work on native slow mode), each message that is successfully sent into the slowed channel will also trigger an automatic deletion of the previous message sent by the user while slow mode is active. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Messages | Bot : Manage Messages Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} sm 1h45m #slow-channel sm 0 #slow-channel-1 #slow-channel-2 slowmode ::: Evasion Actions In addition to the active behavior of the warning commands, the following commands also support a special \\\"evasion\\\" action log: mute imageban cban cmute cimageban An \\\"evasion\\\" action happens when a user that is hit with one of these moderation actions leaves the server and rejoins while the corresponding role is still supposed to be up (either because the timed role still has to expire, or the role has been set as permanent by skipping the corresponding time code). If still applicable, the role will be applied again as soon as the user rejoins the server and an \\\"evasion\\\" log will appear in the warning log. Warning Point System To account for the nature and severity of various infractions, users will incur a certain number of points based on which rule they break. Moderators will be able to use their judgment to adjust the default value of an infraction by adding or subtracting points from the warning. At certain point thresholds, it is recommended that certain moderation actions (such as a mute or ban) be taken against the user. This section will describe the details of the \\\"default\\\" warning point system backend as well as point out options or commands to configure parts of the system. Point Accumulation and Thresholds In addition to a user\\'s total points being the sum of the points of their infractions, the following rules apply to points: Warning points expire after 90 days , at which point the value of the infraction decreases to 1 . The first warning for a particular rule is considered to be a \\\"soft warning\\\" and worth half points (e.g., if a user broke the toxic attitudes rule and the NSFW rule, both infractions would be recorded at half points, but breaking the toxic attitudes rule twice would result in the second infraction being recorded at full points). This behavior can be configured with half-logic {.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}. Each case score can be manually adjusted ( --padj ) but it must always be >= 0. Validation rules are in place for a score not to be negative. Any adjustment that brings the score to a negative value will make the score account for 0. In order to preserve the severity of a banned user\\'s warning history, points for banned users will not expire while the user is banned . Unbanning a user will make the points behave as usual again. The following thresholds apply to the point total of a user. A user reaching one of these thresholds will cause the action log message related to that warning to include a tag of the issuing moderator informing him/her of the user reaching the threshold. 18 unexpired points: The bot will recommend in the action log that the user in question be muted. 27 unexpired points: The bot will recommend in the action log that the user in question be banned. 54 points total, even if expired : The bot will recommend in the action log that the user in question be banned. This is referred to as the \\\"absolute ban threshold\\\". (not implemented yet) Three channel specific warnings : The bot will recommend in the action log that the user be banned from that specific channel, regardless of the total point value. A user can simultaneously reach this threshold and the point thresholds, and the message in the action log should be constructed accordingly. The justification for these thresholds are as follows: Rules are given point values based on a severity from 1 to 10. Since the first infraction is worth half points, only even numbers should be used for rule values. 6 is the average rule value. A \\\"full warning\\\" (i.e., one soft warning and one regular warning) would be 9 points on average. Two \\\"full warnings\\\" should result in a mute, and three should result in a ban. The absolute ban threshold is twice the ban threshold, a considerable feat even in one\\'s lifetime of the server. Default Rules and Points Ideally, users would configure their own rules and point values. However, there are definitely some rules that are common among servers and can be provided as a default hard-coded table. The default table is provided to use as a base: +-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------+---+ | Rule | R | Rule Description | R | | Name | u | | u | | | l | | l | | | e | | e | | | A | | P | | | l | | o | | | i | | i | | | a | | n | | | s | | t | | | | | s | +=======+===+=========================================================+===+ | No | T | Please behave and do not make a nuisance of yourself on | 6 | | Toxic | o | the server, including \\\"trolling\\\" or otherwise being | | | Atti | x | disruptive or making others feel uncomfortable. | | | tudes | i | | | | | c | | | | | A | | | | | t | | | | | t | | | | | i | | | | | t | | | | | u | | | | | d | | | | | e | | | | | s | | | +-------+---+---------------------------------------------------------+---+ | No | O | Please refrain from posting offensive content such as | 8 | | Offe | f | politics, religion, acts of violence, rape, suicide, | | | nsive | f | school shootings, and other serious topics.

By default, this only includes a short summary for each warning. Warn histories longer than 2000 characters are paginated via reaction \\\"buttons\\\". Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} warnhistory 123456789098765432 history \\@cycloptux#1543 ::: case Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} case (case id(s)) ::: Command Description Prints a detailed log embed for the selected case(s). Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} case 2 case 12 15 34 ::: edit Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} edit (case id) [--rule {rule id/name/alias}] [--reason {textual description}] [--attachments {urls}] [--padj {signed/unsigned number}] [--justification {textual justification}] [--skip-dm] ::: Command Description Edits an existing case. You cannot edit a case type (e.g. turning a warn into a mute). Only the original case owner (the issuing moderator) or a server administrator can edit a case. Editing a case will generate a new warning log entry with the new details. The old entry will be edited with a clickable link that will bring you to the new edit. Please refer to moderation for more details about the individual parameters and their aliases. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} edit 3 --reason Spamming phishing links in the #general channel --padj +4 --just For repeated spamming despite being warned about it ::: delete Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} delete (case id(s)) ::: Command Description Deletes one (or more) existing case(s). Deleted cases are never actually removed from the bot memory and can be restored in the future if you remember the case ID(s). Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} delete 3 4 10 ::: restore Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} restore (case id(s)) ::: Command Description Restores one (or more) previously deleted case(s). Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} restore 3 4 ::: listrules Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} listrules [rule id/name/alias] [--server] [--channel [channel id/mention/q_name]] [--mod] ::: Command Description Lists the rules (both custom and default sets) of the server in order by Rule ID, including the Rule Title and Description for each rule. Provide an ID/Name/Alias to show a specific rule only. By default, the list will show both server wide and channel-specific rules. Use --server to limit the rules to the server wide ones. Use --channel with a channel tag to show only channel specific rules for that channel (omitting the channel identifier will show the rules for the current channel). The rule alias and points will be shown if a moderator or administrator appends the --mod parameter to the command. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} listrules listrules --channel #general listrules NSFW --mod ::: addrule Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} addrule (--name {rule name}) (--alias {rule alias}) (--description {rule description}) (--points {rule points (number)}) [--channel [channel id/mention/q_name]] ::: Command Description Adds a custom rule to the rules list. Adding a custom rule generates a server-specific rule ID for that rule automatically, starting from s_1 . Adding a channel identifier will assign that rule as being channel-specific (this is primarily used to track how close a user is to reaching a channel ban threshold) ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Channel ban thresholds are not implemented yet. ::: Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server deleterule Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} delrule (rule(s) id/name/alias) ::: Command Description Deletes a custom rule from the list of rules. Use toggleglobalrule to hide a default rule from the list of rules (see below). ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: In order to preserve the history of users that were previously moderated according to a specific rule, \\\"deleted\\\" rules are never actually deleted. \\\"Deleted\\\" rules are instead hidden , and running the deleterule again on the same rule ID will restore the rule in its previous, visible state. ::: Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server toggleglobalrule Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} toggleglobalrule (rule(s) id/name/alias) ::: Command Description Deletes (hides) a default native rule from the list of rules. Use deleterule to hide a custom rule from the list of rules (see above). ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: In order to preserve the history of users that were previously moderated according to a specific rule, \\\"deleted\\\" rules are never actually deleted. \\\"Deleted\\\" rules are instead hidden , and running the toggleglobalrule again on the same rule ID will restore the rule in its previous, visible state. ::: Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server editrule Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} editrule (rule id/name/alias) [--name {rule name}] [--alias {rule alias}] [--description {rule description}] [--points {rule points (number)}] [--channel [-/channel id/mention/q_name]] ::: Command Description Updates one or more fields of an existing rule to the new values. Use --channel - to convert a channel-specific rule into a server wide rule. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server halflogic Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} halflogic (none/first/first-with-points/each) ::: Command Description As described in point-accumulation , the first warning for a particular rule is considered to be a \\\"soft warning\\\" and worth half points by default. This behavior can be configured as follows: none : Don\\'t halve the points for any warnings. first : Only halve the first warning a user receives (server-wide). first-with-points : Only halve the first warning a user receives excluding 0-points rules warnings (server-wide). each : Halve the first warning a user receives under each rule (default). Using the command with no arguments will show the current settings for the server. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server warnexpiry (not implemented yet) Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} warnexpiry (number of days) ::: Command Description Sets the number of days after which warnings will expire for a particular server. Provide no arguments to reset to the default. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server expirypoints (not implemented yet) Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} expirypoints (number of points) ::: Command Description Sets the number of points a warning will decay to after they expire. Provide no arguments to reset to the default. Any warnings worth fewer points than the expirypoints value will not decay. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Server setthreshold (not implemented yet) Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} setthreshold (\\\"mute\\\"/\\\"ban\\\"/\\\"absban\\\") (number of points) ::: Command Description Sets the number of points at which a mute, ban, or \\\"absolute ban\\\" is recommended.

The list of \\\"warning commands\\\" is the following: warn kick ban delayban mute imageban cban cmute cimageban By default, warning commands will generate a new case if the Warning log is active. Upon generating a case, a DM will be sent to the target user(s), notifying them of the moderation action that has been triggered on them, who issued the moderation action and the specifics of the rules that are broken, if applicable. Please refer to the \\\"Warning Point System\\\" section below for more details about the rules system.

If all of these arguments are skipped, the message will simply read \\\"You were warned/muted/banned by [moderator].\\\". Channel specific commands which are missing the channel parameter will default to being targeted to the current channel. Channels that support time-based expiration (see above) will be treated as permanent if the timecode is missing. You can skip generating a case by appending the --skip-case tag. You can skip sending the DM (but still generate a case) by appending the --skip-dm tag. --skip-case also implies --skip-dm . ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: When --skip-dm is used, a small \ud83d\udd15 emoji will appear on the corresponding notification and warning log embed footer to track the fact that the action was \\\"silent\\\". ::: Every warning, by default, will be worth a certain number of points based on the rule broken (as described in the \\\"Warning Point System\\\" section below. The --padj , or \\\"points added/subtracted\\\" argument, is completely optional and will not be included in the DM even if it is included in the command. Any signed number (\\\"+\\\" or \\\"-\\\") will be treated as a \\\"delta\\\" value over the default rule score, while an unsigned number will be treated as a fixed, absolute value and used as the actual warning score. The justification for points added/subtracted is invalid if no points were added or subtracted and should be ignored if the moderator does not add or subtract any points. Each one of the command parameters has one or more aliases. Here are the available aliases: --rule : --r --reason : --rs --attachments : --attachment --att --a --padj : --pa --p --justification : --just --j --skip-case : --skipcase --nocase --no-case --skip-dm : --skipdm --nodm --no-dm Running the command as the \\\"description\\\" of a Discord attachment (e.g. by drag-and-dropping an image over the Discord client) will automatically add that object as the warning case attachment, even if the --attachments parameter is skipped. As said above, these commands will automatically generate a server-specific case ID that can be used as reference in other commands. An embed including the following information will also be generated and put into the warning log: Warning Type (warn/mute/ban/etc.) Warned user\\'s name Warned user\\'s ID Mod Name Rule broken Reason Attachment (as embed\\'s image, if applicable) Points added/subtracted (optional) Justification (only if points are added/subtracted) Total unexpired points as of warning for this user Suggested moderation action & number of points to next warning threshold Case ID & timestamp (in footer) If any of the rule, reason or attachments parameters are missing, the bot will tag the moderator upon action log generation prompting them to fill in the missing arguments using the edit command. The bot will also tag the moderator the first time that the user reaches a suggested action threshold. Some moderation action commands have a \\\"un-\\\" version that reverts the corresponding moderation action. \\\"un-\\\" commands will follow a similar syntax but will never generate a new case, hence rendering the set of warning parameters (every parameter after the user identifier(s)) useless.

The first warning for a particular rule is considered to be a \\\"soft warning\\\" and worth half points (e.g., if a user broke the toxic attitudes rule and the NSFW rule, both infractions would be recorded at half points, but breaking the toxic attitudes rule twice would result in the second infraction being recorded at full points). This behavior can be configured with half-logic {.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}. Each case score can be manually adjusted ( --padj ) but it must always be >= 0. Validation rules are in place for a score not to be negative. Any adjustment that brings the score to a negative value will make the score account for 0. In order to preserve the severity of a banned user\\'s warning history, points for banned users will not expire while the user is banned . Unbanning a user will make the points behave as usual again. The following thresholds apply to the point total of a user. A user reaching one of these thresholds will cause the action log message related to that warning to include a tag of the issuing moderator informing him/her of the user reaching the threshold. 18 unexpired points: The bot will recommend in the action log that the user in question be muted. 27 unexpired points: The bot will recommend in the action log that the user in question be banned. 54 points total, even if expired : The bot will recommend in the action log that the user in question be banned. This is referred to as the \\\"absolute ban threshold\\\". (not implemented yet) Three channel specific warnings : The bot will recommend in the action log that the user be banned from that specific channel, regardless of the total point value. A user can simultaneously reach this threshold and the point thresholds, and the message in the action log should be constructed accordingly. The justification for these thresholds are as follows: Rules are given point values based on a severity from 1 to 10. Since the first infraction is worth half points, only even numbers should be used for rule values. 6 is the average rule value. A \\\"full warning\\\" (i.e., one soft warning and one regular warning) would be 9 points on average. Two \\\"full warnings\\\" should result in a mute, and three should result in a ban.

Users Leaving Before Verifying , Users Kicked Before Verifying and Users Kicked By Discord are only populated if Members Logging is active in the server (refer to log-command ).

This means that a malicious user knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message containing any kind of content using external tools and send that message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare) occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the --channel (channel id/mention/q_name) parameter: a new dedicated webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be automatically used for this feed.

In this example, if the tweet contains first word and/or (see below) second word , the tweet will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You can set one or more words, case-insensitive. You can also set \\\"composite words\\\" (two or more words as a single filter) by quoting them: \"foo bar\" test will count as 2 filter elements: foo bar and test . The filter works on partial words (e.g. \\\"announce\\\" will work on both \\\"announcement\\\" and \\\"announced\\\"). Default : No filter --mode (AND/OR) Sets the filter behavior when more than 1 word is added to the whitelist filter. AND will only allow tweets that contain all of the filtered words. OR will allow tweets that cointain at least one of the filtered words. Default : OR --include or --exclude Sets the filter behavior one or more words are added to the whitelist filter. --include will only allow tweets that contain the filtered word(s). --exclude will only allow tweets that do not contain the filtered word(s). These parameters will work together with --mode (AND/OR) , allowing the Twitter connector to filter based on INCLUDING the filter items (e.g., at least one filter item (OR) or all filter items (AND) are included in the tweet) or EXCLUDING filter items (e.g., post if all filter items are absent from the tweet (AND) or at least one filter item is absent from the tweet (OR)). Default : --include ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Using both parameters in the same command will give --include the strict priority and ignore --exclude . ::: --header (message) Adds a custom header message when tweets are posted. Custom headers can have a maximum of 1024 characters. Custom headers can be formatted as embeds by following a very specific syntax. Do know that both and Discord are very sensitive to this specific syntax, which is easily \\\"broken\\\" by special characters: for this reason, using embeds as header is not suggested, nor directly supported. Use them at your own risk! If you are brave enough, I suggest the usage of this embed generator (click on the \\\"Enable webhook mode\\\" button at the bottom of the page). Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their respective \\\"real\\\" value during run-time. These are: %screen_name% : This will be replaced with the @ name of an account, minus the @ (e.g. cnnbrk ) %name% : This will be replaced with the actual name of an account. E.g. CNN Breaking News %timestamp% or %timestamp_utc% : This will be replaced with the current UTC time, with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC) . %timestamp_iso% : This will be replaced with the current UTC time, as ISO8601 string. %timestamp_pst% : This will be replaced with the current PST time, with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST) . %url% : This will be replaced with the Twitter status URL. See below for more info. Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the utc part with either: A different valid time zone identifier: use the searchtz command to look for a valid time zone name. An UTC offset , in the form of [UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes] . Here are some valid examples: %timestamp_Europe/London% %timestamp_America/Los_Angeles% %timestamp_Japan% %timestamp_PST8PDT% %timestamp_+0800% %timestamp_-10:30% %timestamp_UTC+2% By default, without an explicit use of %url% , all headers will be followed by the actual Twitter status URL on a new line; rendering of that URL will be done by Discord. If the %url% parameter is used, the default URL will not be appended to the custom header. The Twitter module adds three extra, dynamic placeholders. These dynamic placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding value if the runtime value is present/applicable, or deleted if they are not applicable. These three tags are: %media_url% : This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet, each one on a new line. %media_all_url_if_multiple% : This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet, each one on a new line, only if there\\'s more than 1 media in the tweet . %media_extra_url_if_multiple% : This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet minus the first one , each one on a new line, only if there\\'s more than 1 media in the tweet . By default, the first media on a tweet is shown in the default Discord preview of the tweet. This means that, by using %media_url% or %media_all_url_if_multiple% , you will get a duplicate preview of the first available media (one from the Twitter preview itself, one from the direct link preview. By using %media_extra_url_if_multiple% you can avoid the first media URL from being posted, hence having the default Twitter preview for the first media, and the direct URLs for the 2nd onwards. Default : New tweet from %name%! --webhook-name (custom name) Adds a custom username to the webhook when tweets are posted. Custom usernames can have a maximum of 32 characters.

Use them at your own risk! If you are brave enough, I suggest the usage of this embed generator (click on the \\\"Enable webhook mode\\\" button at the bottom of the page). Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their respective \\\"real\\\" value during run-time. These are: %title% : This will be replaced with the YouTube video title. %channel% : This will be replaced with the YouTube channel name. %duration% : This will be replaced with the YouTube video duration. %video_status% : This will be replaced with the word added if the notification refers to the upload of a new video, or the word updated if the notification refers to the update of a video\\'s title or description. %timestamp% or %timestamp_utc% : This will be replaced with the video upload timestamp in UTC time, with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC) . %timestamp_iso% : This will be replaced with the video upload timestamp in UTC time, as ISO8601 string. %timestamp_pst% : This will be replaced with the video upload timestamp in PST time, with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST) . %url% : This will be replaced with the YouTube video URL. See below for more info. Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the utc part with either: A different valid time zone identifier: use the searchtz command to look for a valid time zone name. An UTC offset , in the form of [UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes] .

If the %url% parameter is used, the default URL will not be appended to the custom header. The YouTube module also supports a few extra, dynamic placeholders. These dynamic placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding value if the runtime value is present/applicable, or deleted if they are not applicable: %description% : This will be replaced with the description of the video, if present and not empty (the description length is truncated at 1024 characters). %short_description% : This will be replaced with a shorter version of the description of the video, if present and not empty (the description length is truncated at 256 characters). %tags% : This will be replaced with a space-delimited list of tags applied to the video, if at least one tag is applied.

No restrictions are applied to the number of Discord servers that can pair a Trello team, although each server must pass the verification step individually (see below). In order to pair with a team, you can use the team name or the URL containing the team name (see the note below). Using the command without any argument will show the current paired Trello team.

Running this command will issue a verification request to the target Trello team, giving the user who run the command a 6-digits unique code (that is generated randomly when the command is run). You must then verify that you have enough permissions to create cards on at least one Team board before the pairing is effective. will start querying the Trello team boards in order to find a card with the 6-digits code set as title.

If no card is found with the correct title within 5 minutes from running the command, the pairing will fail. If the card is found, the pairing will complete and the team boards will be available for use in the Forms module. Once the card is found the pairing will complete, actvating the integration. The verification card will be deleted, and you will be notified (with a mention) in the current channel.

In that case, will start the submission by showing a list of servers the user can select. If used within an actual server, it will make send a DM to the user running the command, showing the available forms for the specific server the command was run into. When the command is used in \\'s DMs, the list of available servers is taken from \\'s current cache. If the server you are looking for does not appear, use the submit command from within that server. This command is not subject to any permissions other than a specific blacklist check (see formblacklist). The actual form submission must always happen though \\'s DMs. ::: submitreact Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreact [--m {message id}] ::: Command Description Other than sending the submit command to via DM, or using it in a server to quickly start the DM workflow, authorized people can enable a specific reaction on a message of choice (or a message created by for that purpose) to have send the initial form submission DM to the user clicking on the reaction. This command starts a simple interactive process to build this \\\"submit reaction message\\\". will guide you through the process of creating this reaction, just follow the in-Discord instructions. If a valid message ID is specified through the dedicated parameter, the submit reaction will be created on the target message. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreact submitreact --m 123456789098765432 ::: submitreactremove Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreactremove [message id] ::: Command Description Removes the submit reaction behavior from an existing message. The message itself won\\'t be deleted, nor the existing reactions will be removed, but will now not do anything with the reaction on that message. If the message ID is omitted (or is invalid), will attempt to pick the latest submit reaction message in the current channel. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} submitreactremove 123456789098765432 ::: adsubmit Command Description Toggles the automatic deletion of the \\\"confirmation\\\" message that is sent upon using the submit command into a server, and of the command itself. The user-sent message will be deleted immediately. The confirmation message will be deleted after 5 seconds. Permissions Needed | User : Manage Messages | Bot : Manage Messages forminit Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} foinit ::: Command Description Initializes a new form builder. The bot will guide the user into setting up the basic configurations and first question. Forms questions will expire after: 5 minutes, for reaction questions; 15 minutes, for open questions. The format to set a form question is: ::: {.parsed-literal} (message/reaction)(list of reactions)/[validation words][Trello mapping] ::: Each question has to be set using 5 fields, separated by one | character. First field: message will require the question to be answered with a plain text message. reaction will require the user to select one answer by clicking on a reaction that will be added to the question by the bot. Second field: The actual question. Third field: If reaction is selected in the first field, this field will list all of the possible answers, using ; to separate these answers. If this is the case, this field is mandatory . If message is selected in the first field, this field will include a list of validation words: any answer given by the target user will be ignored unless the message contains at least one of the chosen words/sentences (case insensitive). Again, you can separate words/sentences with ; . If this is the case, this field is optional. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Due to Discord limitations, there can only be a maximum of 20 answers in a reaction question. Answers from the 21st onward will be ignored. ::: Fourth field: The question \\\"alias\\\". This is the title that will replace the full question when the feedback is posted in the server channel. This field is optional, but it\\'s higly suggested that you set an alias. Fifth field: This will map the question into one of the entities of the Trello board. While private and attachment have a meaning in in-Discord share mode (see formsetup), the rest is only useful if you are interested in Trello integration; you can choose whether or not including Trello integration later: title will use the answer as the title of a card. list will use the answer as the title of a list. label will add the answer as a card label. attachment will add the answer as a card attachment. If the \\\"attachments highlighting\\\" option is active, fields flagged as attachment will also appear in the public in-Discord summary message. description will add the answer as part of the description text, with the format: {Alias}: {Text} . private will show the answer into the \\\"in-Discord\\\" embed during the authorization process but won\\'t upload the field to Trello (or show it in the public in-Discord summary message) whatsoever. ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: A field being \\\"optional\\\" means that its content can be left blank, but the field itself has to exist; e.g. message|Heads or Tails?||The user picked...| ::: ::: {.hint} ::: {.title} Hint ::: In order to ease the creation of these complex strings, you can use this Forms Builder Helper to create a pre-made string to be used in this phase. Just create a copy of that sheet and customize it to your needs. ::: formsetup Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} foset (form id) ::: Command Description Opens the forms builder interactive configuration menu. Use the menu items to configure the available settings. {.align-center width=\"400px\"} Options 1. and 2. are used to save the settings you applied through the menu (the settings will not apply until you save them), or discard said changes. \\\"Set title\\\" sets the title of the form, as it appears when listed by . \\\"Set color\\\" sets the form embeds color. \\\"Set authorization channel\\\" sets the channel where form submissions are sent to for the initial validation by the authorized users. This option is mandatory. \\\"Set forwarding channel(s)\\\" sets the additional forwarding channels where, if set, the public in-Discord summary message will be sent to. This is optional. \\\"Set authorized role(s)\\\" sets the list of roles that will be both authorized to accept and reject submissions to the current form, and mentioned (optional, see option 18) within the authorization channel when a submission is received. \\\"Toggle share mode\\\" sets the final target of a validated submission to either Trello, or just Discord. \\\"Toggle publish status\\\" works as an alias of formpublish and formwithhold to make a form available or unavailable for server members through \\'s DMs. \\\"Toggle upvoting\\\" enables or disables the upvote tracking feature (and upvote arrow application for new submissions) on a specific form. \\\"Toggle downvoting\\\" enables or disables the downvote tracking feature (and downvote arrow application for new submissions) on a specific form. ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Disabling a voting arrow will not remove the :arrow_up: and/or :arrow_down: reaction from existing submissions, but it will stop those submissions\\' votes from being tracked in Trello (if you are using the Trello share mode). New submissions will not have the corresponding arrow reaction applied. Enabling a previously disabled voting arrow will not reapply the arrow to existing submissions. It will track the votes as long as any user adds the :arrow_up: and/or :arrow_down: reaction to the public submission message (as long as it\\'s the native Discord reaction and not a custom one). ::: \\\"Toggle highlighting of attachments\\\" enables or disables the public embed from having an additional field where all of the \\\"attachment\\\"-flagged fields are linked, using their gisl.eu short link (using the same engine behind shorturl ). \\\"Set mentioned role(s)\\\" sets the list of roles that will be mentioned in the public in-Discord summary message(s) when a submission is accepted. (Only useful in \\\"Trello share mode\\\") \\\"Set target board\\\" lists the available boards within the paired Trello team (refer to trellopair ) and sets the linked Trello board for the current form. Renaming a board in Trello will not affect this link. (Only useful in \\\"Trello share mode\\\") \\\"Toggle extended embed\\\" enables or disabled the public in-Discord summary message extended mode: by default, a submission that has Trello set as \\\"share mode\\\" will only show a short summary of the submission, while the actual full post will be found in the linked Trello card. By enabling the \\\"extended embed\\\", the whole submission will be kept within Discord, while still having a link to the corresponding Trello card. (Only useful in \\\"Discord share mode\\\" or \\\"Trello share mode\\\" with \\\"extended embed\\\" active) \\\"Anonymize public submissions\\\" completely hides the submitter info from the public in-Discord summary message, keeping the user\\'s anonymity intact (as long as \\\"private\\\"-flagged fields are used for other kinds of recognizable data within the form). \\\"Anonymize rejection messages\\\" enables or disables whether the name of the user that rejected a submission will appear in the rejection message on a specific form. \\\"Mention the authorized role(s) on new submissions\\\" toggles whether the authorized role(s) will be mentioned when a new submission is received. \\\"Toggle priority reactions\\\" toggles whether the priority reactions are applied to the validation message. When this option is off, the only options will be \\\"Pass (No Priority)\\\" and \\\"Drop\\\". Here\\'s an example of a public in-Discord summary message with Trello share mode, extended embed, attachments highlighting and anonymizer on. {.align-center width=\"600px\"} formaddqst Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} foaq (form id) ::: Command Description Adds a question to an existing form.

When delaying a command, the permission checks for the target command will be checked both during the first scheduling request, and then re-checked at run-time. This means that any user willing to schedule an administrator-locked command, will have to have administrator permissions when running the initial scheduler command, and still have administrator permissions by the time the command is scheduled to run. Failing either checks will reject the command run (either by not letting the user schedule the command at all, or failing at run-time). It doesn\\'t matter if a user temporarily loses permissions in between the scheduler command and the actual target command, as long as they have enough permissions when the scheduler is due. The scheduled command will be ignored if the user is not in the server, or loses \\\"Read Messages\\\" or \\\"Send Messages\\\" permissions in the channel they run the scheduler command into, by the time the command is due to run. Again, it doesn\\'t matter if the user temporarily leaves the server or loses those permissions, as long as they are back up when the scheduler is due. will notify the channel where the scheduler command was run into as soon as the command is due. The bot must still have \\\"Read Messages\\\" and \\\"Send Messages\\\" permissions in that channel to notify the command run before actually running the scheduled command. Failing the notification will also abort the actual command run. The current implementation of the command is experimental. As soon as it\\'s stable and hardened, 2 more features will be added: Scheduling a command as \\\"recurring\\\" , hence being run every N minutes . Scheduling a command to be run on a different channel than the one where you originally set the scheduler into. ::: {.admonition} Premium By default, each server is limited to scheduling commands within a time interval of no more than 1 hour . You can unlock higher interval times as a Premium feature (see: premium-perks {.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}): Tier 1 patron servers will have their cap increased to 12 hours .

These commands might be safe for use by anyone, or locked behind in-Discord permissions. NSFW Images Detection Tools implements an (experimental) NSFW images detection system using TensorFlow.js as its base. The detection system is based on Infinite Red\\'s NSFW JS library and GantMan\\'s Inception v3 Keras Model for NSFW detection to classify any image as a composition of 5 categories: Drawings : Safe for work drawings (including anime). Hentai : Hentai and pornographic drawings. Neutral : Safe for work neutral images. Porn : Pornographic images, sexual acts. Sexy : Sexually explicit images, not pornography. The module was furtherly converted into a back-end module and customized with a caching system to enhance its performance. ::: {.seealso} This interesting article by Infinite Red explains the reasons behind the creation of the original NSFW JS client-side module. ::: ::: {.warning} ::: {.title} Warning ::: This module, by no means, is supposed to reliably recognize all NSFW images. Its main purpose is quickly classifying provided images and supporting humans in better moderating a server. The module itself will not store or expose any sexually explicit images. The output will not contain a direct link to the original image, and a censored (low resolution, blurred) version of the image will be locally cached and used to refer to the original image. ::: Here\\'s an example of an output of this command, and the corresponding censored image: {.align-center width=\"600px\"} ::: {.seealso} For those of you with a background in image processing - yes, Lenna is actually flagged as NSFW with a confidence score of 81.9%! If you don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about, refer to this Wikipedia page . ::: nsfwcheck Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} nsfwcheck (image URL, or image as a message attachment) ::: Command Description Submits an image against the GantMan\\'s Inception v3 Keras Model for NSFW detection (as explained above) and returns a detailed output about the classification. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} nsfwcheck http://www.lenna.org/lena_std.tif ::: nsfwcache Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} nsfwcache (cache ID) ::: Command Description Recalls an image classification output by its cache ID (as given in the footer of the nsfwcheck command. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} nsfwcache 5d6c4cd78e422b00137d14ce ::: nsfwthreshold Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} nsfwthreshold [new threshold, or \\\"-\\\"] ::: Command Description While the classification scores given to an image cannot be tuned, each server can choose its own NSFW threshold (the sum of NSFW-related scores over which an image is considered NSFW). The new threshold is an integer within the range [0, 100] , inclusive of 0 (treat all images as NSFW) and 100 (only treat an image as NSFW if the model recognize it as having no-SFW components - which is highly unlikely, hence basically meaning \\\"treat no images as NSFW\\\"). Running the command with - as argument will reset the server threshold to the global, default threshold of 60% . Running the command with no arguments will show the current value for the server.

If the --detail additional parameter is used, the command will attempt scanning the top 3 most used bot listing websites to get info about the bot owner, and post a link to the found page. The command will scan: Top.gg / Discord Bot List : https://top.gg/ Bots on Discord : https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/ Discord Bots : https://discord.bots.gg/ This additional scan is usually very slow (about \\~5 seconds per bot). serveremojis Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} semoji ::: Command Description Shows all of the emojis from the current server into an embed. createinvite Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} createinvite [--channel {channel id/mention/q_name}] [--expire {duration timecode}] [--uses {number of uses}] [--unique] [--temporary] ::: Command Description Creates an instant invite to the current server. All parameters are optional, here are the meanings of eaach parameter and the default values: --channel selects a target channel for the invite. The user running the command must have \\\"View Channel\\\" and \\\"Create Instant Invite\\\" permissions on the target channel. Default : the current channel. --expire sets how long the invite should last (use the time code syntax, e.g. 1h ). Default : no expiration. --uses sets the maximum number of uses for the invite. Default : unlimited uses. --unique create a unique invite if selected, or uses an existing one with similar settings otherwise. Timed invites are always unique by default. Default : false (use an existing if available). --temporary sets whether members that joined via the invite should be automatically kicked after 24 hours if they have not yet received a role. Default : false. --alias adds an optional alias (one word, maximum 32 characters long) to the invite. If the Members logger with invites tracking is active (refer to log-command {.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}) the alias will be shown under \\\"Using Invite: ...\\\". Default : no alias.

You must specify the time zone name: if you need to search for a valid time zone name, use the searchtz command. In addition to the listed time zones, custom UTC offsets are supported, in the form of [UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes] . Here are some valid examples: -9 +800 -230 -10:30 UTC+2 GMT-4:30 ... ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: Beware that the offset forms of the Etc/UTC area have a counterintuitive behavior, having their sign reversed from the standard ISO 8601 convention (e.g. \\\"Etc/GMT-14\\\" is 14 hours ahead of GMT) (more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database#Area ). If you want to specify a custom offset, use the simple \\\"UTC\\\" form instead of \\\"Etc/UTC\\\", as stated above. ::: You can set a custom template for the channel name. You can use one (or more) of these placeholders in your custom channel name template: %time_zone% or %tz% : This will be replaced with the name of the chosen time zone. %clock% : This will be replaced with the auto-updating clock. %date% : This will be replaced with the current date. Additionally, you can add the --12ht parameter if you want the clock to be shown as 12 hours time. By default, the channel name template is %time_zone%: %clock% . ::: {.admonition} Premium Out of the box, each server is limited to having 2 clock channels . You can unlock up to 10 different clock channels as a Premium feature (see: premium-perks ). Clock update frequency cannot be changed. ::: ::: {.note} ::: {.title} Note ::: The initial implementation of this command used to have clcks update every minute. Discord suddenly changed the rate limit of channel updates to 2 updates every 10 minutes , but the rate limiter is not precise. The 10\\~15 minutes update seems to be the safest update that is still useful to track time. ::: Permissions Needed | User : Manage Channels, Manage Server | Bot : Manage Channels, Connect Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} clockchannel UTC clockchannel GMT-8 clockchannel Europe/London --12ht clockchannel America/New_York --template Current Time: %clock% ::: clockchanneldelete Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} clockchanneldelete [channel id/mention/name] ::: Command Description Deletes a clock channel, bypassing Discord\\'s implicit denial: normally, \\\"Manage Channels\\\" does not apply if the user doesn\\'t have \\\"Connect\\\" permissions to the channel. As long as has \\\"Connect\\\" permissions, this channel will allow users to delete the clock channel.

Using a 2-letters country identifier will show the available time zones for the specified country. Using any 3+ characters string will search for matching time zones. Examples ::: {.parsed-literal} searchtz US searchtz New ::: membercountchannel Command Syntax ::: {.parsed-literal} membercountchannel [--template {custom channel name template}] ::: Command Description Creates a channel as \\\"member count channel\\\", showing the total amount of users that are currently in the server, updating its value every hour. You can set a custom template for the channel name. If you do so, you must use the %count% placeholder in your custom channel name template. By default, the channel name template is Members: %count% . You can only have 1 member count channel up at any time.

Giveaway Campaigns
==================

The Giveaway Campaigns module enables users to start and manage
giveaways in a Discord server.

gcstart
-------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
gcstart \[\--channel {channel id/mention/q\_name}\] \[\--prize {prize
name}\] \[\--winners {\# of winners (number)}\] \[\--duration {duration
timecode}\] \[\--roles {role(s) id/mention/q\_name}\] \[\--max {\# of
users after which the bot will stop the giveaway (number)}\]
:::

### Command Description

Starts a new giveaway in a channel (the current channel, if the
`--channel` parameter is omitted). Members can participate by clicking
on the reaction that is added by the bot.

If the `--roles` parameter is used, the giveaway will only select
winners among those participants that have **at least one of the
selected roles** at the time of closure of the giveaway. The `--roles`
parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the `--max` parameter,
using both will ignore the `--max` parameter.

All parameters are optional, the default values (on omission) are:

-   **Channel**: Current channel
-   **Prize Name**: \"Sample Prize\"
-   **Winners**: 1
-   **Duration**: 1 day (24 hours)
-   **Roles Restriction**: *None* (All participants will be considered)
-   **Max**: *None* (Infinite)

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Users must still be members of the server at the time of the giveaway
campaign end for them to be rolled as winners. Users that are not in the
server when the campaign ends will not be considered. Bots reacting to
the giveaway campaign will always be ignored.

### Examples

\--prize Blue Hat \--winners 5 \--roles \@BluePeople \@WearingHats

(if applicable) or maximum amount of users (if applicable, refer to the

### Command Description

Immediately ends a giveaway and picks a winner (or more winners) among

most recent giveaway in the channel will be considered.

gcreroll \[message id\] \[\--winners {\# of winners (number)}\]
:::

### Command Description

Picks one (or more, if the `--winners` parameter is used) new winner(s)
for an already ended giveaway. The message ID is optional: if omitted,
the most recent (ended) giveaway in the channel will be considered.

You can only reroll up to 10 winners per command run.

This command will not overwrite the existing winners in the original
message. It will also keep track of former winners and previous rerolls
to make sure that the new winners weren\'t already picked in a previous
iteration of the command.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Users must still be members of the server at the time of the giveaway

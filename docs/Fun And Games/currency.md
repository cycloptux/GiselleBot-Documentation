Currency System
===============

Each user known to the bot has a currency wallet. Currency is earned in
a few ways:

-   Each message sent in a channel the bot has access to will give a
    small amount of currency to the user (a cooldown is applied to avoid
    plain spamming just to earn currency).
-   Once a day, using the `timely`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    command.
-   Every once in a while, reacting to events on the main bot support
    server.
-   Playing with `games`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Currently, the main goal of currency is playing with games. More uses
are planned, but still not implemented.

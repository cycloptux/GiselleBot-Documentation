Currency System
===============

Each user known to the bot has a currency wallet. Currency is earned in
a few ways:

-   Each message sent in a channel the bot has access to will give a
    small amount of currency to the user (a cooldown is applied to avoid
    plain spamming just to earn currency).
-   Once a day, using the [{{bot.prefix}}timely](/GiselleBot-Documentation/Fun And Games/currency#timely) command.
-   Every once in a while, reacting to events on the main bot support
    server.
-   Playing with [{{bot.prefix}}games](/GiselleBot-Documentation/Fun And Games/games).

Currently, the main goal of currency is playing with games. More uses
are planned, but still not implemented.

Stonk Market: Buying and Selling Broccoli
-------------

The **Stonk Market** allows users to buy and sell ðŸ¥¦ broccoli at
fluctuating prices, just like real stock markets.

ðŸ¥¦ Broccoli can be purchased **every Sunday morning before 12 PM UTC**.
Their price fluctuates over time: **the purchase price will be different
every week, and in every server**. During the week, users can sell ðŸ¥¦
broccoli at different prices to make a profit. These prices will differ
each morning and afternoon, and again, for each server.

The pricing algorithm is the same that powers Animal Crossing: New
Horizons's Stalk Market. You can read more about it
[here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bSVNpOnH_dKxkAGr718-iqh8s8Z0qQ54L-0mD-lbrXo/view)

Buying prices vary between 90 and 110 currency per head of ðŸ¥¦ broccoli.
There's no limit on how many you can buy or sell.

ðŸ¥¦ Broccoli must be sold within a week. Otherwise, **they will rot by the
following Sunday morning and lose their monetary value**. {{bot.name}}

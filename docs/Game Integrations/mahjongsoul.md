Mahjong Soul Integration
========================

This module contains a few commands used to get information about
**Mahjong Soul**, a Japanese mahjong game platform developed by Cat Food
Studio and distributed, in its English and Japanese version, by Yostar.
The game is available as a browser game, with Android and iOS mobile
apps to be released in the future.

The game was released in 3 regions/versions:

-   **CN** (Chinese)
-   **JP** (Japanese)
-   **EN** (English/Global)

Commands
--------

### mjsstatus

#### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
mjsstatus \[\--region {region code}\]
:::

#### Command Description

Checks the status of Mahjong Soul\'s game servers. Omitting the region
code will assume `--region en` and show the status of the (4, at the
time of writing this page) English servers.

#### Examples

::: {.parsed-literal}
mjsstatus mjsstatus \--region cn
:::

Server Status Live Feed
-----------------------

The Mahjong Soul Server Status Feed offers an easy way to monitor
Mahjong Soul servers availability for **any region**, and be notified
when something changes on one (or more) of the webhooks configured in
your Discord server.

::: {.seealso}
In order to better understand this module, it\'s very important that you
are familiar with Discord webhooks. For more details about this Discord
feature, please take a look at [this official
guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
:::

By default, the status feed mascot will be the Mahjong Soul character
**Ichihime**, and all of the feed messages will be Mahjong Soul-themed.

The full list of feed messages and monitored transitions can be found
[in this Google
Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pp-jVN2KOlx0e0sg0lUldqfNBqtKXs1cUGXdhHHjpLQ/edit?usp=sharing).

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

The spreadsheet contains a few yellow lines that are currently not used
for technical reasons. These will be populated if/when they\'ll be
applicable.
:::

Each message will be followed by a list of hashtags, that users may use
to filter the specific messages they are interested into, indicating:

-   The region code whom the message refers to: `#cn` `#en` `#jp`
-   The current status of the region, using a technical status tag:
    `#gateway_error` `#maintenance` `#partial_maintenance`
    `#server_outage` `#operational`
-   If maintenance notes are found, the message will print the
    maintenance notes (and track their changes throughout a
    maintenance).
-   The quote ID (refer to the [Mahjong Soul Server Status Feed
    Sentences Google
    Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pp-jVN2KOlx0e0sg0lUldqfNBqtKXs1cUGXdhHHjpLQ/edit?usp=sharing))
    for the region status transition and/or server status transition:
    e.g. `#r_01` `#r_02` `s_02` \...

### mjshook

#### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
mjshook (webhook URL or \--channel (channel id/mention/q\_name))
\[customization params\]
:::

#### Command Description

Starts a live feed on the specified webhook. When a new transition is
found, its notification will be sent to the specified webhook service.

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack
2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user
knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message
containing any kind of content using external tools and send that
message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare)
occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels.
:::

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the
`--channel (channel id/mention/q_name)` parameter: a new (unique)
webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be
automatically used for this feed.

This alternative option requires to have \"Manage Webhooks\"
permissions.
:::

**Customization Params**

##### `--region (first region code) [second region code] [...]`

Adds a **whitelist**, **inclusive** filter for Mahjong Soul server
regions to the stream. Transitions that are referring to (one of) the
selected region(s) will be sent to the webhook, while the rest will be
skipped.

This parameter only supports these region codes: `cn` `en` `jp`

Region codes are case-insensitive.

**Default**: No filter (all regions)

##### `--filter (first word) [second word] [...]`

Adds a **whitelist** filter to the feed. In this example, if the status
quote contains `first word` and/or (see below) `second word`, the
submission will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You
can set one or more words, case-insensitive. This is especially
effective if you are using the provided hashtags to filter specific
events of interest.

You can also set \"composite words\" (two or more words as a single
filter) by quoting them: `"foo bar" test` will count as 2 filter
elements: `foo bar` and `test`.

The filter works on partial words (e.g. \"announce\" will work on both
\"announcement\" and \"announced\").

The filter only checks the \"quote text\", column **G** of the [Mahjong
Soul Server Status Feed Sentences Google
Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pp-jVN2KOlx0e0sg0lUldqfNBqtKXs1cUGXdhHHjpLQ/edit?usp=sharing),
and the additional message hashtags (if you filter by hashtag, you must
include the \"\#\").

**Default**: No filter

##### `--mode (AND/OR)`

Sets the filter behavior when more than 1 word is added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `AND` will only allow status transition notifications that contain
    *all* of the filtered words.
-   `OR` will allow status transition notifications that cointain at
    least one of the filtered words.

**Default**: `OR`

##### `--include` or `--exclude`

Sets the filter behavior one or more words are added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `--include` will only allow status transition notifications that
    contain the filtered word(s).
-   `--exclude` will only allow status transition notifications that
    **do not** contain the filtered word(s).

These parameters will work together with `--mode (AND/OR)`, allowing the
server status feed to filter based on INCLUDING the filter items (e.g.,
at least one filter item (OR) or all filter items (AND) are included in
the submission) or EXCLUDING filter items (e.g., post if all filter
items are absent from the submission (AND) or at least one filter item
is absent from the submission (OR)).

**Default**: `--include`

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Using both parameters in the same command will give `--include` the
strict priority and ignore `--exclude`.
:::

##### `--header (message)`

Adds a custom header message when status transition notifications are
posted. Custom headers can have a maximum of **1024** characters.

Custom headers **can** be formatted as embeds by following a very
specific syntax. Do know that both and Discord are very sensitive to
this specific syntax, which is easily \"broken\" by special characters:
for this reason, using embeds as header is not suggested, nor directly
supported. **Use them at your own risk!** If you are brave enough, I
suggest the usage of [this embed
generator](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/) (click on the
**\"Enable webhook mode\"** button at the bottom of the page).

Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their
respective \"real\" value during run-time. These are:

-   **%region%**: This will be replaced with the region name,
    capitalized (e.g. `Chinese`, `English`, \...)
-   **%region\_code%**: This will be replaced with the region code,
    uppercase (e.g. `CN`, `EN`, \...)
-   **%timestamp% or %timestamp\_utc%**: This will be replaced with the
    status transition UTC time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC)`.
-   **%timestamp\_iso%**: This will be replaced with the status
    transition UTC time, as ISO8601 string.
-   **%timestamp\_pst%**: This will be replaced with the status
    transition PST time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST)`.

Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the `utc`
part with either:

-   A different **valid** time zone identifier: use the
    `searchtz`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} command to look for a valid
    time zone name.

-   An **UTC offset**, in the form of
    `[UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes]`. Here are some valid examples:

    > -   %timestamp\_Europe/London%
    > -   %timestamp\_America/Los\_Angeles%
    > -   %timestamp\_Japan%
    > -   %timestamp\_PST8PDT%
    > -   %timestamp\_+0800%
    > -   %timestamp\_-10:30%
    > -   %timestamp\_UTC+2%

All headers will be followed by the actual quote text, including the
additional hashtags.

**Default**:
`Jyanashi Sama, Ichihime here with an important message for you from the %region% region!`

##### `--webhook-name (custom name)`

Adds a custom username to the webhook when status transition
notifications are posted. Custom usernames can have a maximum of 32
characters.

**Default**: \"MahjongSoul雀魂 Status Feed :: Offered by \"

##### `--no-username-overwrite`

Removes any custom name from the webhook. The real webhook name (the one
that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be used.

**Default**: `false` (Custom or default names will be applied)

##### `--no-avatar-overwrite`

Removes any custom avatar from the webhook. The real webhook avatar (the
one that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be
used.

**Default**: `false` (Automated avatars will be applied)

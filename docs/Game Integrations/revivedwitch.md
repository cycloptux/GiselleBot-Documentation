Revived Witch Connector
=======================

This module sends news from **Revived Witch**, a pixel-art RPG mobile
game distributed by Yostar, to the specified webhook or channel.

::: {.seealso}
In order to better understand this module, it\'s very important that you
are familiar with Discord webhooks. For more details about this Discord
feature, please take a look at [this official
guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

rwhook
------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
rwhook (webhook URL or \--channel (channel id/mention/q\_name))
\[customization params\]
:::

### Command Description

Starts a live feed on the specified webhook. When some news is found,
they will be sent to the specified webhook service.

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack
2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user
knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message
containing any kind of content using external tools and send that
message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare)
occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels.
:::

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the
`--channel (channel id/mention/q_name)` parameter: a new dedicated
webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be
automatically used for this feed.

This alternative option requires to have \"Manage Webhooks\"
permissions.

**Customization Params**

#### `--event (first event) [second event] [...]`

Adds a **whitelist**, **inclusive** filter for specific news events to
the service. News will only be sent if the actual news type is equal to
one of the filtered events.

The **only** supported events for this feed are: `Updates`, `Event`,
`Notice`

**Default**: No filter

#### `--filter (first word) [second word] [...]`

Adds a **whitelist** filter to the feed. In this example, if the news
title contains `first word` and/or (see below) `second word`, the event
will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You can set one
or more words, case-insensitive.

You can also set \"composite words\" (two or more words as a single
filter) by quoting them: `"foo bar" test` will count as 2 filter
elements: `foo bar` and `test`.

The filter works on partial words (e.g. \"announce\" will work on both
\"announcement\" and \"announced\").

**Default**: No filter

#### `--mode (AND/OR)`

Sets the filter behavior when more than 1 word is added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `AND` will only allow status transition notifications that contain
    *all* of the filtered words.
-   `OR` will allow status transition notifications that cointain at
    least one of the filtered words.

**Default**: `OR`

#### `--include` or `--exclude`

Sets the filter behavior one or more words are added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `--include` will only allow status transition notifications that
    contain the filtered word(s).
-   `--exclude` will only allow status transition notifications that
    **do not** contain the filtered word(s).

These parameters will work together with `--mode (AND/OR)`, allowing the
server status feed to filter based on INCLUDING the filter items (e.g.,
at least one filter item (OR) or all filter items (AND) are included in
the submission) or EXCLUDING filter items (e.g., post if all filter
items are absent from the submission (AND) or at least one filter item
is absent from the submission (OR)).

**Default**: `--include`

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Using both parameters in the same command will give `--include` the
strict priority and ignore `--exclude`.
:::

#### `--header (message)`

Adds a custom header message when status transition notifications are
posted. Custom headers can have a maximum of **1024** characters.

Custom headers **can** be formatted as embeds by following a very
specific syntax. Do know that both and Discord are very sensitive to
this specific syntax, which is easily \"broken\" by special characters:
for this reason, using embeds as header is not suggested, nor directly
supported. **Use them at your own risk!** If you are brave enough, I
suggest the usage of [this embed
generator](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/) (click on the
**\"Enable webhook mode\"** button at the bottom of the page).

Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their
respective \"real\" value during run-time. These are:

-   **%title%**: This will be replaced with the news title.
-   **%content%**: This will be replaced with the news content
    (truncated at 1024 characters).
-   **%short\_content%**: This will be replaced with a shorter version
    of the news content (truncated at 256 characters).
-   **%banner%**: This will be replaced with the news banner URL, if
    present.
-   **%timestamp% or %timestamp\_utc%**: This will be replaced with the
    status transition UTC time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC)`.
-   **%timestamp\_iso%**: This will be replaced with the status
    transition UTC time, as ISO8601 string.
-   **%timestamp\_pst%**: This will be replaced with the status
    transition PST time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST)`.

Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the `utc`
part with either:

-   A different **valid** time zone identifier: use the
    `searchtz`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} command to look for a valid
    time zone name.

-   An **UTC offset**, in the form of
    `[UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes]`. Here are some valid examples:

    > -   %timestamp\_Europe/London%
    > -   %timestamp\_America/Los\_Angeles%
    > -   %timestamp\_Japan%
    > -   %timestamp\_PST8PDT%
    > -   %timestamp\_+0800%
    > -   %timestamp\_-10:30%
    > -   %timestamp\_UTC+2%

All headers will be followed by the actual quote text, including the
additional hashtags.

**Default**: `Dear Master, some news was just published!`

#### `--webhook-name (custom name)`

Adds a custom username to the webhook when status transition
notifications are posted. Custom usernames can have a maximum of 32
characters.

**Default**: \"Revived Witch News Feed :: Offered by \"

#### `--no-username-overwrite`

Removes any custom name from the webhook. The real webhook name (the one
that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be used.

**Default**: `false` (Custom or default names will be applied)

#### `--no-avatar-overwrite`

Removes any custom avatar from the webhook. The real webhook avatar (the
one that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be
used.

**Default**: `false` (Automated avatars will be applied)

Instagram Connector
===================

The Instagram connector offers an easy way to stream new posts and
stories from any Instagram account to one (or more) of the webhooks
configured in your Discord server.

::: {.seealso}
In order to better understand this module (and the rest of the connector
modules), it\'s very important that you are familiar with Discord
webhooks. For more details about this Discord feature, please take a
look at [this official
guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
:::

By default, each new post will be posted to the webhook by using the
Instagram account username as author, and the account profile icon (if
present) as Discord profile picture. These settings (and other details)
can be customized for each stream.

Instagram post URLs will be posted to Discord, while the submission
preview will leverage the native parsing of Instagram content offered by
Discord (not available at the time of writing this page, but you can use
custom header tags to show more info on each post).

This module will only work on **public accounts**.

::: {.title}
Note
:::

The goal of this module is offering a **free alternative** to something
that is usually only achieved through the use of paid services. On the
other hand, due to limitations that are applied to the Instagram API,
this module might suffer from delays (new posts will be checked **every
1\~3 hours**, and users\' info may take up to 24 hours to be refreshed)
and/or miss a few posts in high-traffic accounts (**the module will only
catch up to 50 new posts in each check window**).

instahook
---------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
instahook (Instagram username) (webhook URL or \--channel (channel
id/mention/q\_name)) \[customization params\]
:::

### Command Description

Starts a streaming service for the selected Instagram account. If a new
submission is found, it will be sent to the specified webhook service.

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack
2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user
knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message
containing any kind of content using external tools and send that
message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare)
occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels.
:::

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the
`--channel (channel id/mention/q_name)` parameter: a new dedicated
webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be
automatically used for this feed.

This alternative option requires to have \"Manage Webhooks\"
permissions.

**Customization Params**

#### `--filter (first word) [second word] [...]`

Adds a **whitelist** filter to the stream. In this example, if the post
caption contains `first word` and/or (see below) `second word`, the
submission will be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You
can set one or more words, case-insensitive.

You can also set \"composite words\" (two or more words as a single
filter) by quoting them: `"foo bar" test` will count as 2 filter
elements: `foo bar` and `test`.

The filter works on partial words (e.g. \"announce\" will work on both
\"announcement\" and \"announced\").

**Default**: No filter

#### `--mode (AND/OR)`

Sets the filter behavior when more than 1 word is added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `AND` will only allow submissions that contain *all* of the filtered
    words.
-   `OR` will allow submissions that cointain at least one of the
    filtered words.

**Default**: `OR`

#### `--include` or `--exclude`

Sets the filter behavior one or more words are added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `--include` will only allow submissions that contain the filtered
    word(s).
-   `--exclude` will only allow submissions that **do not** contain the
    filtered word(s).

These parameters will work together with `--mode (AND/OR)`, allowing the
Instagram connector to filter based on INCLUDING the filter items (e.g.,
at least one filter item (OR) or all filter items (AND) are included in
the submission) or EXCLUDING filter items (e.g., post if all filter
items are absent from the submission (AND) or at least one filter item
is absent from the submission (OR)).

**Default**: `--include`

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Using both parameters in the same command will give `--include` the
strict priority and ignore `--exclude`.
:::

#### `--header (message)`

Adds a custom header message when submissions are posted. Custom headers
can have a maximum of **1024** characters.

Custom headers **can** be formatted as embeds by following a very
specific syntax. Do know that both and Discord are very sensitive to
this specific syntax, which is easily \"broken\" by special characters:
for this reason, using embeds as header is not suggested, nor directly
supported. **Use them at your own risk!** If you are brave enough, I
suggest the usage of [this embed
generator](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/) (click on the
**\"Enable webhook mode\"** button at the bottom of the page).

Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their
respective \"real\" value during run-time. These are:

-   **%username%**: This will be replaced with the Instagram account
    username
-   **%fullname%**: This will be replaced with the Instagram account
    full name, as set by the user
-   **%caption%**: This will be replaced with the caption/description of
    the media being posted
-   **%media\_url%**: This will be replaced with the direct URL to the
    media content (image or video) of the post
-   **%display\_url%**: This will be replaced with the direct URL to the
    media content (image if the post is an image, or static image from
    the video if the post is a video) of the post
-   **%hashtags%**: This will be replaced with the list of hashtags that
    are included in the post
-   **%profile\_url%**: This will be replaced with the direct URL to the
    profile of the user
-   **%profile\_pic%**: This will be replaced with the direct URL to the
    profile picture of the user
-   **%total\_posts%**: This will be replaced with the total number of
    posts from the user, as shown in the user\'s profile
-   **%followed%**: This will be replaced with the total number of
    accounts that the user if following, as shown in the user\'s profile
-   **%follower%**: This will be replaced with the total number of
    followers of the user, as shown in the user\'s profile
-   **%timestamp% or %timestamp\_utc%**: This will be replaced with the
    post creation UTC time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC)`.
-   **%timestamp\_iso%**: This will be replaced with the post creation
    UTC time, as ISO8601 string.
-   **%timestamp\_pst%**: This will be replaced with the post creation
    PST time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST)`.
-   **%url%**: This will be replaced with the Instagram post direct URL.
    See below for more info.

Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the `utc`
part with either:

-   A different **valid** time zone identifier: use the
    `searchtz`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} command to look for a valid
    time zone name.

-   An **UTC offset**, in the form of
    `[UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes]`. Here are some valid examples:

    > -   %timestamp\_Europe/London%
    > -   %timestamp\_America/Los\_Angeles%
    > -   %timestamp\_Japan%
    > -   %timestamp\_PST8PDT%
    > -   %timestamp\_+0800%
    > -   %timestamp\_-10:30%
    > -   %timestamp\_UTC+2%

By default, without an explicit use of `%url%`, all headers will be
followed by the actual Instagram post direct URL on a new line.

If the `%url%` parameter is used, the default URL will **not** be
appended to the custom header.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Do note that Discord doesn\'t support the automatic rendering of
Instagram URLs (yet). If you want to show the content of the Instagram
post in Discord, use the above custom tags or keep the default header:
the default header builds an embeds that previews the content of the new
Instagram post.
:::

**Default**: `New post from %author%!` followed by the post URL and an
embed showing the post

#### `--webhook-name (custom name)`

Adds a custom username to the webhook when submissions are posted.
Custom usernames can have a maximum of 32 characters.

**Default**: New submissions will be displayed by a webhook with the
username of the Instagram account

#### `--no-username-overwrite`

Removes any custom name from the webhook. The real webhook name (the one
that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be used.

**Default**: `false` (Custom or automated names will be applied)

#### `--no-avatar-overwrite`

Removes any custom avatar from the webhook. The real webhook avatar (the
one that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be
used.

**Default**: `false` (Automated avatars will be applied)

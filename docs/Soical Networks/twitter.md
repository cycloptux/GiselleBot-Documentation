Twitter Connector
=================

The Twitter connector offers an easy way to stream tweets from any
Twitter account to one (or more) of the webhooks configured in your
Discord server.

::: {.seealso}
In order to better understand this module (and the rest of the connector
modules), it\'s very important that you are familiar with Discord
webhooks. For more details about this Discord feature, please take a
look at [this official
guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
:::

By default, each tweet will be posted to the webhook by using the
Twitter account username as author, and Twitter avatar as Discord
profile picture. These settings (and other details) can be customized
for each stream.

Replies and retweets are always ignored.

Tweet URLs will be posted to Discord, while the tweet preview will
leverage the native parsing of Twitter content offered by Discord.

The goal of this module is offering a **free alternative** to something
that is usually only achieved through the use of paid services. On the
other hand, due to limitations that are applied to the free Twitter API,
this module might suffer from command cooldowns and/or miss a few tweets
every once in a while.

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
twthook (Twitter username) (webhook URL or \--channel (channel
id/mention/q\_name)) \[customization params\]
:::

### Command Description

Starts a streaming service for the selected Twitter account. If a new
tweet is found, it will be sent to the specified webhook service.

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

Discord webhooks are a very powerful feature, but they (currently) lack
2-way authentication of messages. This means that a malicious user
knowing a webhook URL will be able, with some effort, to forge a message
containing any kind of content using external tools and send that
message to the webhook. In order to protect yourself from this (rare)
occasion, make sure you run this command in non-public channels.
:::

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Alternatively, you can replace the webhook URL with the
`--channel (channel id/mention/q_name)` parameter: a new (unique)
webhook will be created and the URL from the new webhook will be
automatically used for this feed.

This alternative option requires to have \"Manage Webhooks\"
permissions.

**Customization Params**

#### `--nsfw [censor/skip/only]`

Twitter streams may be parsed to look for \"bad words\" or \"possibly
sensitive\" content before being posted.

Depending on the selected parameter, these are the NSFW behaviors:

-   **censor** will post a NSFW URL surrounded by `< >` angle brackets,
    disabling the default Discord URL auto-embed preview.
-   **skip** will completely ignore NSFW-flagged items, \"cleaning\" the
    stream from NSFW items.
-   **only** will only post NSFW-flagged items and skip the rest. The
    items will not be censored. You can use this mode to create a
    complementary NSFW stream of the previous \"clean\" stream.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

This check is unaccurate. If you know that the Twitter account you are
going to stream is \"safe for work\", you can safely skip this check.
This is usually the suggested behavior if you know what you\'re doing.
:::

**Default**: `false` (both SFW and NSFW -uncensored- items will be
posted), or `censor` if `--nsfw` is used without any specific mode.

#### `--filter (first word) [second word] [...]`

Adds a **whitelist** filter to the stream. In this example, if the tweet
contains `first word` and/or (see below) `second word`, the tweet will
be sent to the webhook, otherwise it will ignored. You can set one or
more words, case-insensitive.

You can also set \"composite words\" (two or more words as a single
filter) by quoting them: `"foo bar" test` will count as 2 filter
elements: `foo bar` and `test`.

The filter works on partial words (e.g. \"announce\" will work on both
\"announcement\" and \"announced\").

**Default**: No filter

#### `--mode (AND/OR)`

Sets the filter behavior when more than 1 word is added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `AND` will only allow tweets that contain *all* of the filtered
    words.
-   `OR` will allow tweets that cointain at least one of the filtered
    words.

**Default**: `OR`

#### `--include` or `--exclude`

Sets the filter behavior one or more words are added to the whitelist
filter.

-   `--include` will only allow tweets that contain the filtered
    word(s).
-   `--exclude` will only allow tweets that **do not** contain the
    filtered word(s).

These parameters will work together with `--mode (AND/OR)`, allowing the
Twitter connector to filter based on INCLUDING the filter items (e.g.,
at least one filter item (OR) or all filter items (AND) are included in
the tweet) or EXCLUDING filter items (e.g., post if all filter items are
absent from the tweet (AND) or at least one filter item is absent from
the tweet (OR)).

**Default**: `--include`

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Using both parameters in the same command will give `--include` the
strict priority and ignore `--exclude`.
:::

#### `--header (message)`

Adds a custom header message when tweets are posted. Custom headers can
have a maximum of **1024** characters.

Custom headers **can** be formatted as embeds by following a very
specific syntax. Do know that both and Discord are very sensitive to
this specific syntax, which is easily \"broken\" by special characters:
for this reason, using embeds as header is not suggested, nor directly
supported. **Use them at your own risk!** If you are brave enough, I
suggest the usage of [this embed
generator](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/) (click on the
**\"Enable webhook mode\"** button at the bottom of the page).

Custom headers support a few dynamic tags that are replaced with their
respective \"real\" value during run-time. These are:

-   **%screen\_name%**: This will be replaced with the `@` name of an
    account, minus the `@` (e.g. `cnnbrk`)
-   **%name%**: This will be replaced with the actual name of an
    account. E.g. `CNN Breaking News`
-   **%timestamp% or %timestamp\_utc%**: This will be replaced with the
    current UTC time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC)`.
-   **%timestamp\_iso%**: This will be replaced with the current UTC
    time, as ISO8601 string.
-   **%timestamp\_pst%**: This will be replaced with the current PST
    time, with format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (PST)`.
-   **%url%**: This will be replaced with the Twitter status URL. See
    below for more info.

Timestamp tags also support custom time zones. You can replace the `utc`
part with either:

-   A different **valid** time zone identifier: use the
    `searchtz`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} command to look for a valid
    time zone name.

-   An **UTC offset**, in the form of
    `[UTC/GMT](+/-)(hours)[:][minutes]`. Here are some valid examples:

    > -   %timestamp\_Europe/London%
    > -   %timestamp\_America/Los\_Angeles%
    > -   %timestamp\_Japan%
    > -   %timestamp\_PST8PDT%
    > -   %timestamp\_+0800%
    > -   %timestamp\_-10:30%
    > -   %timestamp\_UTC+2%

By default, without an explicit use of `%url%`, all headers will be
followed by the actual Twitter status URL on a new line; rendering of
that URL will be done by Discord.

If the `%url%` parameter is used, the default URL will **not** be
appended to the custom header.

The Twitter module adds three extra, dynamic placeholders. These dynamic
placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding value if the
runtime value is present/applicable, or **deleted** if they are not
applicable.

These three tags are:

-   **%media\_url%**: This will be replaced with the direct URLs to all
    medias posted in the tweet, each one on a new line.
-   **%media\_all\_url\_if\_multiple%**: This will be replaced with the
    direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet, each one on a new
    line, **only if there\'s more than 1 media in the tweet**.
-   **%media\_extra\_url\_if\_multiple%**: This will be replaced with
    the direct URLs to all medias posted in the tweet **minus the first
    one**, each one on a new line, **only if there\'s more than 1 media
    in the tweet**.

By default, the first media on a tweet is shown in the default Discord
preview of the tweet. This means that, by using `%media_url%` or
`%media_all_url_if_multiple%`, you will get a duplicate preview of the
first available media (one from the Twitter preview itself, one from the
direct link preview.

By using `%media_extra_url_if_multiple%` you can avoid the first media
URL from being posted, hence having the default Twitter preview for the
first media, and the direct URLs for the 2nd onwards.

**Default**: `New tweet from %name%!`

#### `--webhook-name (custom name)`

Adds a custom username to the webhook when tweets are posted. Custom
usernames can have a maximum of 32 characters.

**Default**: New tweets will be displayed by a webhook with the screen
name of the Twitter account (the `@` name of that account, minus the
`@`)

#### `--no-username-overwrite`

Removes any custom name from the webhook. The real webhook name (the one
that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be used.

**Default**: `false` (Custom or automated names will be applied)

#### `--no-avatar-overwrite`

Removes any custom avatar from the webhook. The real webhook avatar (the
one that you assigned when creating the webhook in Discord) will be
used.

**Default**: `false` (Automated avatars will be applied)

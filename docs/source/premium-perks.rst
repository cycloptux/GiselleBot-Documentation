Throughout this documentation, you'll find a few notes about Premium-locked features. These features are only unlocked by either becoming a Patron for the developer, or by establishing a partnership with the developer.

Here's a link to our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/cycloptux

As a way to cover the hosting (and development) costs of the bot and its infrastructure, Patreon is used as the main source of month-to-month income.

.. seealso::
    `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/>`_ is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists and creators to get paid. Within the Patreon dictionary, subscribers are called "patrons".

Here's a summary of the available Premium tiers and the corresponding unlocked perks, the pricing details will be on the Patreon page.

More perks will be added over time, including free currency and early access to new features!

.. warning::
    You should be the **owner**, or an **administrator** (or a representative of similar rank), of the server you're activating the Patreon perks for.

{{bot.name}} was born as a "small" project to help the Brave Frontier-based
Coalition (a group of people that played the same mobile game, Brave
Frontier, from gumi Inc.) handle the kind-of-complicated (and fully
documented, thanks to my friend and business partner NaviKing) members
application workflow.

Over time, a lot of side functions were added to help with day-to-day
Discord usage, moderation, logging, roles management and so on.

Nowadays, the bot is used on servers both large and small, official and
unofficial. Built with security in mind, this actively developed bot is
feature rich while still being flexible and easy to use. Key features
include:

-   Points based automatic and manual moderation system with half a
    dozen possible moderation actions, configurable rules list, and
    prompts to ensure moderators fill out every required piece of
    information on a warning for impeccable moderation documentation.
-   Self assignable roles' system that includes the ability to add roles
    to yourself via message reactions, not just bot commands! Configure
    groups of self assignable roles separately to require (or forbid)
    certain roles for obtaining them and set a minimum and maximum
    number of roles in each group
-   Deep logging, including members, channels, roles, messages, server,
    voice, and moderation-related actions (including logging of deleted
    attachments)
-   Social networks integrations, streaming tweets from Twitter to
    Discord in real-time (more integrations to come)
-   New user management, including greet messages, automatically
    assigned roles, and automatically removed roles
-   Permissions system to configure the usage of each module
-   Social and currency system to allow users to rank up based on
    activity and earn currency to use on games in the bot
-   Unique form builder module for creating guild applications, feedback
    surveys, bug reports, and so much more; all within Discord
-   Unique Raid Room module to allow people to create and disband
    temporary voice and text channels for co-op (or competitive)
    gameplay
-   Custom reactions: create your own commands with your own input and
    output text!
-   Music: listen to music in your voice channels
-   Much, much more!

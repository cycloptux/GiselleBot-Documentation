Verification
============

The verification module acts as a gate in order to assign (or remove)
certain roles to users after making sure they are humans.

Human verification is achieved through text/audio captchas that are
randomly generated and sent to the user via DM.

verify
------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
verify
:::

### Command Description

Requests a new captcha verification, provided that \"verification via
command\" is enabled through `verifysetup`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Users will receive a new randomly generated captcha via text image, and
the same captcha as audio file (for visually-impaired users).

Users will have **5 minutes** to complete the captcha request. If the
timer expires, or if **3 wrong codes** are submitted, the captcha
verification will fail.

Users leaving and re-joining the server **will not** receive a new
captcha until the previous one has expired.

Users will be able to submit a code through the code pseudo-command as a
response to the direct message sent by .

verifysetup
-----------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
verifyset
:::

### Command Description

Opens an interactive menu to configure the verification module.

Here\'s an explanation of the available parameters:

-   \"Toggle captcha verification **on join**\" will send a captcha
    verification message to all users joining the server.
-   \"Toggle captcha verification **via command**\" will send a captcha
    verification message upon using the verify command.

These options can be enabled at the same time or only one of them,
depending on your desired setup. These options **will not turn on**
unless both \"Set **main** verification channel\" and \"Set
post-verification role(s)\" are correctly set.

-   \"Set **main** verification channel\" will configure the channel as
    the only channel where the verify command will work. Users will also
    be mentioned in here if they can\'t be reached through DM.
-   \"Set **fallback** verification channel\" will configure the channel
    as a secondary channel where error message will be sent for
    verifications triggered by a join event. The verify command **will
    not** work in the fallback channel. Verification attempts via
    command will still send the feedback to the main channel.
-   \"Set post-verification role(s)\" will set one or more role to be
    assigned (or removed, depending on the following setting) to users
    when they successfully verify. At least one role is mandatory for
    the verification feature to be enabled.
-   \"Toggle post-verification role mode\" will configure whether the
    post-verification role(s) will be assigned or removed upon
    successfully verifying.

Do note that, if post-verification role mode is set to **Remove**, the
user must have the selected role(s) assigned **before the verification
starts**. If you are using verification **on join**, you might want to
configure the automatic role assignment on join through the
`autoassignrole`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} feature (verification
will natively wait for that role to be assigned before starting the
verification on the user).

Using a different bot for the automatic assignment of the role on join
might cause the role to be missing when the verification is due to
start, hence causing the verification to fail.

-   \"Set verification log channel(s)\" will configure one or more
    channels as \"logging channel\", hence receiving a notification upon
    successful and failed verifications.
-   \"Set daily stats channel(s)\" will configure one or more channels
    as \"stats channel\", where the daily
    `verifystats`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} output will be
    automatically sent each day at midnight, UTC.
-   \"Automatically kick upon failed verification\" will configure
    whether a user failing the verification (due to their timer expiring
    or too many errors) will be kicked. If this option is disabled,
    users will be left untouched in the server and will be able to
    request a new verification by using the verify command (if enabled)
    or by leaving and re-joining the server.
-   \"Bypass if the user verified at least once **in this server**\"
    will skip verification for those users that successfully verified at
    least once in the current server.
-   \"Bypass if the user verified at least once **in any server**\" will
    skip verification for those users that successfully verified at
    least once in any server.
-   \"Set a custom message for verifying users\" will allow server
    managers to set an additional short (**500 characters maximum**)
    message that will be delivered to each user that attempts verifying
    in that server. This message will be appended to the default
    instructions message that is sent via DM.

Premium

The custom message feature is only available to **Premium**-enabled
servers (see: `premium-perks`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

verifystats
-----------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
verifystats
:::

### Command Description

Prints some statistics about the verification module for the current day
(referring to UTC midnight). You cannot request stats for previous days.

Here\'s an explanation of the available stats:

-   \"Users Sent Captchas\" is the total number of sent captchas. It
    should normally be the sum of the following params, except for some
    edge cases.
-   \"Users Passed\" is the number of successfully passed captchas.
-   \"Users Failed (Timer Expired)\" and \"Users Failed (Too Many
    Errors)\" refer to captchas that were failed **while the user was
    still in the server**. Depending on the configuration of the module,
    this number also indicates the number of kicked users, if auto-kick
    is enabled.
-   \"Users Leaving While Verifying\" refers to users that left the
    server on their own (while verifying) **before** their verification
    timeout was over.
-   \"Users Kicked While Verifying\" refers to users that were kicked
    for reasons unrelated to the verification process (while verifying)
    **before** their verification timeout was over.
-   \"Users Kicked By Discord\" refers to users that may have been
    kicked by Discord\'s automatic system for being flagged as
    suspicious accounts.
-   \"Errored Captchas\" refers to verifications that resulted in errors
    due to misconfigurations or other undefined problems (e.g. Discord
    API errors).
-   \"Average Time To Verify\" only takes into account **Passed**
    verifications.
-   \"Average Errors\" only takes into account **Passed**, **In
    Progress**, and **Failed** verifications.

**Users Leaving Before Verifying**, **Users Kicked Before Verifying**
and **Users Kicked By Discord** are only populated if **Members
Logging** is active in the server (refer to
`log-command`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

In order to properly recognize whether a user left on their own or was
kicked, \"View Audit Log\" permissions must be given to .

If **Members Logging** is disabled, the above values will all be added
to the **Errored Captchas** statistics.

verifyuser
----------

### Command Syntax

::: {.parsed-literal}
verifyuser (user id(s)/mention(s)/q\_name(s))
:::

### Command Description

Manually verifies one or more users. The corresponding log entry will
track the user that run the command.

The user(s) will be notified of the manual verification. The author of
the command will not be disclosed in the notification DM.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Manually verified users will not appear in the verification module
stats. Also, manually verifying a user will not count as a valid
verification in regards to the verification bypass logic.

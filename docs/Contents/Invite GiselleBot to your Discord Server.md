Invite to your Discord Server
=============================

{{bot.name}} is a public bot and can be invited by anyone in any server.

If you share a Discord server with, it is advised that you get an
update invite by running invite in any channel she's in (usually, look
for a bot spam channel, just in case).

If you don't, here's a direct invite: <{{bot.invite}}>

The set of permissions that asks for enables most, if not all, of its
commands in your server. Giving administrator permissions is advised if
you are going to use it for logging and moderation purposes, but it's
not required.

    By default, not all of GiselleBot's commands are enabled for everyone in a
    server. Refer to `permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
    info.

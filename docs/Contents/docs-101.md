Modules Documentation 101
=========================

Throughout the whole documentation website, you'll find different ways
of explaining commands and a few keywords to indicate particular ways of
writing a parameter.

Server/Guild, Channel, Message, Role, User IDs
----------------------------------------------

!!!abstract "Note:"

        Each entity in Discord is mapped with a unique ID. Knowing what an ID
        is, and how to get the ID of a said entity is crucial to knowing how a
        bot works. Obtaining an ID also requires that you have Discord's
        Developer Mode active.

        There are a lot of guides and tutorials about how to activate Developer
        Mode and how to get an ID for an entity in Discord. [This
        link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)
        will bring you to the official Discord support page about this topic.

        Obtaining a role ID may be trivial: you can obtain the role ID by
        prepending a role mention with `\`, but, that message will still mention
        the role.

        In order to make your life easier, the bot offers a
        `{{ bot.prefix }}roleid` command.

Parenthesis
-----------

Parenthesis are used into command syntax snippets. The type of
parenthesis indicates whether that parameter or string is mandatory,
optional or just a simple description (hence, not an actual part of the
command).


| Type | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
| `()` | Mandatory   |
| `[]` | Optional    |
| `{}` | Description |

Names and Double Quotes
-----------------------

Within the documentation, you may find the tag `q_name` in command
syntax snippets. That's a short name for "name surrounded by double
quotes", and is generally used for Discord user, channel or role
**plain** names:

!!!example "Example"

    "cycloptux Development#1543"
    
    "Role With Spaces"


Time Format Code
----------------

### Standard Time Code

Time is indicated through the use of a standard time format,
which consists of 5 (or 6) time bits:

| Time Bit | Meaning   |
|----------|-----------|
| `mo`     | month(s)  |
| `w`      | week(s)   |
| `d`      | day(s)    |
| `h`      | hour(s)   |
| `m`      | minute(s) | 


If specified, the time code may allow an extra bit, `s` for second(s).
Each time bit has to be prepended with an actual (positive, integer)
number, or omitted if the corresponding time bit would be set to 0.

!!! warning "Important Note"

    While some flexibility is allowed in time codes, be
    sure to write the time bits in the correct order:
    
    `mo > w > d > h > m > s`

That said, a typical time code would be like this:

`2mo6h40m = 2 months, 6 hours, 40 minutes`

### Timestamp Mentions

While the standard time code represents a time span (or duration) in an
explicit form (e.g. 3 hours; 10 minutes from now; etc.), each command
that supports a time code can also be used with a "timestamp mention"
(refer to [Message
Formatting](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting),
"Unix Timestamp" or "Unix Timestamp (Styled)").

When using timestamp mentions as a time code replacement, will
automatically convert the timestamp into the corresponding "time from
now" interval to be used as time span.

This may be particularly useful in some use cases when trying to trigger
an action at a certain time of a day (e.g. reminders, repeating
messages, scheduled commands, etc.).

!!! Tip "Tip"

    You can easily create such timestamp mentions in a Discord-ready syntax
    using [HammerTime](https://hammertime.djdavid98.art/) by
    [DJDavid98](https://djdavid98.art).

!!! warning "Warning"

    Using timestamp mentions as time code will only work if the timestamp
    you are using refers to a future date.
